# Linear Algebra

Learning linear Algebra. The plan is to take notes and write sample code in python while learning.

## Eye vs Ear

- How our eyes perceive light vs how our ears perceive sound.
- Eye is very complex. Retina has 120 million rods and 6 million cones. The brain has to process all this information. Resolution of the eye is 576 megapixels, while the best monitors have 33 megapixels.
- Ear has a single sensor. Ear takes in the sum of all the sound waves. The brain processes this information. The ear has a resolution of 4000 bits per second, while the best microphones have 1000 bits per second.

## Approximating area under a curve

Area under a curve can be approximated using rectangles, trapezoids, or Guassian Quadrature.

## Guassian Quadrature

- Guassian Quadrature is a method for numerical integration. It is based on the idea that the integral of a function can be approximated by a weighted sum of the function at certain points. The weights and points are chosen in such a way that the approximation is extremely accurate.

This is related to linear algebra somehow ðŸ˜…

## Addition of Sounds

- If a sound is simply an array of numbers, then adding two sounds is simply adding two arrays.
- If we add two sounds, we get a new sound that is the sum of the two sounds.

```py
bach + mlk # adding Bach and LMK speech
0.5*bach + mlk # adding half amplitude of Bach with LMK speech
```

## Decomposition

- Decomposition is not possible, in these examples:
  + I have some 5 rupee coins, some 10 rupee coins. Total is 100 rupees. How many 5 rupee coins and 10 rupee coins do I have? -> This has some finite number of solutions.
  + If count can be negative, then there are infinite solutions.
- For sound it is possible to decompose. We can decompose a sound into a sum of other sounds.
- In a situation, can we decompose? Classifications:
  + Decomposition is possible in a unique way.
  + Decomposition is not unique - infinite ways to decompose.
  + Decomposition is not possible - can't be decomposed.

## The Three Fundamental Examples of Vectors

## Vectors

> Vectors are the kinds of objects that can be:
>   + Added together
>   + Multiplied by a number
>   
> To create an object of the same kind.

## Geometric Vectors

- A geometric vector is a directed segment.
- Least abstract objects - since they are drawings.
- Much of inspiration and intuition in the world of linear algebra comes from geometric vectors.

## Polynomials

- Polynomials are vectors.
- We can throw in sines, cosines, exponentials too. We can add two functions, and multiply a function by a number.
- Functions are vectors too!
- Polynomials is **a vector sub-space** of functions.

- Space of vectors is very useful to physicists.
- Mathematicians and physicists have a healthy obsession with exact mathemical expressions. They like to capture phenomena in the world with exact mathematical expressions.

## $\mathbb{R}^n$

- $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.
- As abstract as it gets. When in everydya life do we encounter n-tuples of real numbers?

They are very important kinds of vectors:
1. The algorithms of linear algebra are stated, formulated, explored in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
2. Computers are particularly helpful if yyou can restate your problem in terms of sets of numbers.
3. All spaces look like $\mathbb{R}^n$.

By studying $\mathbb{R}^n$, we are studying all other kinds of vector spaces.
