## Linear Algebra and its Three Pillars

### 1. Subspaces
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Dimension
  - Linear dependence and independence
  - Solutions to linear systems: $Ax = b$
  - Particular solutions and general solutions
  - Linear decomposition
  - Null spaces

- **Focus**:
  - Counting dimensions and subspaces.
  - Applications: solving equations, matrix multiplication, etc.

---

### 2. Linear Transformations
- **Definition**: Operations that take a vector and return another vector while preserving linearity.

- **Key Concept**: Eigenvalues ($Ax = \lambda x$):
  - Central to the study of linear transformations.
  - Important notions: reflections, projections, and interpreting derivatives as linear transformations.
  
- **Emphasis**:
  - Describing transformations geometrically.
  - Applications across various contexts like reflections, projections, and rotations.

### 3. Inner Products
- **Motivation**:
  - Introduces the concept of **length** into linear algebra.
  - Bridges geometric vectors with other structures like $\mathbb{R}^n$, polynomials, electrical signals, etc.

- **Why Needed**:
  - Proximity: Measures how "close" one solution is to another.
  - Applications: Finding the "closest solution" in cases where no exact solution exists (e.g., least squares problem).

### Length and Distance in Linear Algebra

#### Geometric Vectors
- **Standard Length**:
  $$
  \text{Length of a vector: } \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}
  $$
  This definition is intuitive but specific to geometric vectors.

#### Beyond Geometric Vectors
- Introducing **length** for entities like polynomials or electrical signals requires broader concepts.
- **Challenge**:
  - Defining length directly is arbitrary.
  - The solution lies in defining **inner products** from which length can be derived.

### A Conceptual Example with Subspaces and Approximation
#### Context:
- Consider a linear system with $Ax = b$, but no exact solution due to inconsistency.

#### Problem:
- Find the vector in the column space of $A$ that is **closest** to $b$.

#### Visualization:
1. The column space of $A$ spans a plane (in 3D space).
2. Vector $b$ lies outside this plane.
3. The goal is to find the projection of $b$ onto the plane.

#### Geometric Insight:
- The **closest vector** minimizes the distance (perpendicular/orthogonal direction) from $b$ to the plane.

### Least Squares
- **Definition**:
  The **least squares problem** minimizes the distance between a given vector and a subspace.
  
- **Key Idea**:
  - Measure distances using inner productâ€“induced lengths.
  - Applications include approximations when systems have no exact solutions.

---

### Inner Products: The Foundation of Length
- **Definition**:
  An **inner product** is a generalization of the scalar product for geometric vectors.

- **Importance**:
  - Length and angles derive from inner products.
  - Unified framework for geometric and abstract spaces.

- **Applications in Linear Algebra**:
  - Defining lengths for vectors in spaces like $\mathbb{R}^n$, polynomial spaces, etc.
  - Foundational to applied mathematics, including Gaussian integration, signal processing, and more.

### Broadening the Concept of Length
- **Key Principle**:
  - There is no single definition of length.
  - Different definitions (e.g., weighted sums of coefficients) might be used depending on the context.

---

### Moving Forward
- **Next Steps**:
  - Explore scalar (inner) products for geometric vectors.
  - Generalize to other vector spaces.
  - Demonstrate how lengths, angles, and projections follow naturally from inner product definitions.
