### 1. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Divergence Theorem

- **Goal**:
  Prove L is a self-adjoint operator in one dimension, then extend discussion to multivariable calculus using the Divergence Theorem.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Used in the proof for one-dimensional case.
  - Divergence Theorem: Generalizes the Fundamental Theorem to higher dimensions.

---

### 2. Self-Adjoint Operator

#### Definition:
An operator \( L \) is self-adjoint if:

$$
\langle u, Lv \rangle = \langle Lu, v \rangle
$$

#### Example:
Consider functions \( u \) and \( v \). The second derivative operator \( L \) acts as:

$$
\langle u, Lv \rangle = \int_0^1 u(x) v''(x) \, dx
$$

---

### 3. Integration by Parts

#### Approach:
- Use the product rule in reverse:
  
$$
\int u v'' dx = [u v']_0^1 - \int u' v' dx
$$

- Boundary Conditions:
  Functions vanish at boundaries (\( u(0) = u(1) = 0 \)). The boundary term \([u v']_0^1\) drops out.

#### Result:
$$
\int_0^1 u v'' dx = - \int_0^1 u' v' dx
$$

This shifts the derivative from \( v \) to \( u \), picking up a minus sign.

---

### 4. Multiple Applications of Integration by Parts

#### Process:
1. Apply integration by parts again to:
   $$ 
   \int_0^1 u' v' dx 
   $$

   This becomes:
   $$ 
   \int_0^1 u' v' dx = - \int_0^1 u'' v \, dx
   $$

2. Result:
   $$ 
   \int_0^1 u v'' dx = \int_0^1 u'' v \, dx
   $$

Boundary terms drop out again.

### 5. Properties of the Laplacian Operator (\(\Delta\))

#### Summary:
- **Self-Adjointness**:
  The Laplacian is self-adjoint because:

  $$ 
  \langle u, \Delta v \rangle = \langle \Delta u, v \rangle
  $$

- **Negative Definiteness**:
  
  The Laplacian is negative definite. If \( u \neq 0 \), then:
  $$ 
  \langle u, \Delta u \rangle < 0
  $$

#### Key Implications:
- All eigenvalues of the Laplacian are **real**.
- Eigenfunctions are **orthogonal** (or can be orthogonalized).
- Negative definiteness excludes constant functions (boundary conditions need zeros).

---

### 6. Motivation and Importance

- **Why Self-Adjoint Operators Matter**:
  - Self-adjoint operators have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenfunctions.
  - The Laplacian’s eigenfunctions (e.g., sines and cosines in Fourier series) are orthogonal.

- **Connection to Linear Algebra**:
  - Self-adjoint operators are analogous to symmetric matrices.
  - Theories in calculus and applied mathematics often reduce to special cases of results in linear algebra.

---

### 7. Practical Applications

#### Consequences of Self-Adjointness:
- Self-adjoint operators facilitate decomposition of functions into orthogonal components.
- Essential for solving differential equations, spectral analysis, and numerical methods.

#### Laplacian in Higher Dimensions:
- Extends to multivariable contexts using Divergence Theorem.
- Operates consistently across vector spaces and transformations.

---

### Recap

- **Summary of Key Points**:
  - The Laplacian is self-adjoint, negative definite, and key to orthogonality and real eigenvalues.
  - Integration by parts is foundational to understanding this operator’s behavior.
  - Linear algebra provides a unifying framework for studying such operators in arbitrary spaces.
