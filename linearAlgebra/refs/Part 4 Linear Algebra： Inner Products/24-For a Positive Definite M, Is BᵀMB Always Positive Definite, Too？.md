## Symmetric Matrices: Properties and Applications

### Symmetric Matrices

- Symmetric matrices are among the best and most fundamental matrices. They have numerous special properties that make them everyone's favorites.

### Key Concept: $B^\top B$

- At the end of the previous lecture, we considered the matrix $B^\top B$.  
  - **Symmetry**: $B^\top B$ is symmetric.
  - **Positive Definiteness**:  
    - If the columns of $B$ are **linearly independent**, then $B^\top B$ is **positive definite**.  
    - If they are **not linearly independent**, then $B^\top B$ is **positive semi-definite**.

### A More General Case: $B^\top M B$

- Now consider $B^\top M B$, where $M$ is a **symmetric positive definite matrix**.  
- Questions:  
  1. Is $B^\top M B$ symmetric?  
  2. Is $B^\top M B$ positive definite?

### Symmetry of $B^\top M B$

- A matrix $A$ is symmetric if $A^\top = A$.  
- Computing the transpose of $B^\top M B$:  

$$
(B^\top M B)^\top = B^\top M^\top B = B^\top M B 
$$

- Since $M$ is symmetric ($M^\top = M$), $B^\top M B$ is symmetric. âœ…

### Positive Definiteness of $B^\top M B$

- To test positive definiteness, consider the quadratic form $x^\top A x$, where $A = B^\top M B$.  
- Substitute $A$:  

$$
x^\top A x = x^\top (B^\top M B) x
$$

- Introduce $y = Bx$. Then we can rewrite:  

$$
x^\top A x = y^\top M y
$$

- Since $M$ is positive definite:  
  - If $y \neq 0$, then $y^\top M y > 0$.  
  - If $y = 0$, then $x$ must lie in the **null space of $B$**.

### Analysis of Null Space

- If the columns of $B$ are **linearly dependent**, then $B$ has a **non-trivial null space**.  
  - In this case, $y = Bx$ could be zero, leading to $x^\top A x = 0$.  
  - $B^\top M B$ is **positive semi-definite**.  
- If the columns of $B$ are **linearly independent**, $B$ has no null space.  
  - As a result, $y \neq 0$ for any non-zero $x$, and $x^\top A x > 0$.  
  - $B^\top M B$ is **positive definite**.

### Conclusion for $B^\top M B$

- **Case 1**: Columns of $B$ are **linearly independent**  
  - $B^\top M B$ is **strictly positive definite**.  
  - $x^\top A x > 0$ for all $x \neq 0$.  
- **Case 2**: Columns of $B$ are **linearly dependent**  
  - $B^\top M B$ is **positive semi-definite**.  
  - $x^\top A x \geq 0$, with equality for certain $x$.

### Importance of Observations

- Understanding the behavior of $B^\top M B$ is crucial for leveraging properties of symmetric matrices.
- These results will lay the foundation for analyzing additional properties and implications in upcoming discussions.
