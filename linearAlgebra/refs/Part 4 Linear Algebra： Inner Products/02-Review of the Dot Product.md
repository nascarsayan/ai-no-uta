## The Dot Product and Projection

### Geometric Vectors and Their Properties
- In linear algebra, the exploration begins with geometric vectors.
- From geometric concepts like **lengths** and **angles**, we build mathematical tools and definitions that generalize to other spaces.

### Definition of the Dot Product
- The **dot product** (or **scalar product**) between two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is denoted as $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$. 
- **Definition**:
    $$
    \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos \gamma
    $$
    where:
    - $\|\mathbf{a}\|$ is the length (magnitude) of vector $\mathbf{a}$,
    - $\|\mathbf{b}\|$ is the length (magnitude) of vector $\mathbf{b}$,
    - $\gamma$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

### Key Observations About the Dot Product
1. The dot product is **numerical** (a scalar).
2. The concept of **length** and **angle** precedes the definition of the dot product:
   - Length: Measured using a "tape measure."
   - Angle: Measured using a "protractor."
3. Inner products generalize the dot product to other mathematical spaces.

### The Dot Product in Action: Projection
#### Scenario:
- Given two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ (where $\mathbf{b}$ is not necessarily orthogonal to $\mathbf{a}$), find the **projection** of $\mathbf{a}$ onto $\mathbf{b}$.

#### Geometric Projection Formula:
1. **Projection Direction**:
    - The projection $\mathbf{p}$ must point in the direction of $\mathbf{b}$.
    - Hence, $\mathbf{p}$ is proportional to $\mathbf{b}$: 
      $$
      \mathbf{p} = c \mathbf{b}.
      $$
    - For some scalar $c$.

2. **Determining the Scalar** $c$:
    - The **length** of $\mathbf{p}$ is given by:
      $$
      \|\mathbf{p}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \cos \gamma
      $$
      where $\gamma$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.
    - Using the relationship between dot products and lengths:
      $$
      \cos \gamma = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|}.
      $$

    - Therefore, the magnitude of $\mathbf{p}$ becomes:
      $$
      \|\mathbf{p}\| = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}.
      $$

3. **Final Projection Formula**:
    - Given that $\mathbf{p}$ is proportional to $\mathbf{b}$:
      $$
      \mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}.
      $$

### Important Notes on Projection
- The formula for projection avoids direct computation of vector magnitudes and angles:
    - All terms can be expressed purely in terms of **dot products**.
    - Explicitly: 
      $$
      \mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}.
      $$
- **Key Insight**:
    - Using only the dot product, projection eliminates the need for:
      - Vector lengths or magnitudes ($\|\cdot\|$),
      - Trigonometric functions (e.g., $\cos \gamma$).

---

### Orthogonal Decomposition
- Any vector $\mathbf{a}$ can be decomposed into two components:
  1. A **parallel component**: $\mathbf{p} = \text{Proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a}$.
  2. A **perpendicular component**: $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{p}$.
- **Key Formulas**:
  - $\mathbf{p} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}$
  - $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{p}$.

---

### Lengths Expressed Through Dot Products
- From the definition of a dot product, we can compute the length of a vector:
    $$
    \|\mathbf{a}\| = \sqrt{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}}.
    $$
- **Significance**:
    - This shows that lengths themselves can be expressed purely in terms of the **dot product**.
    - However, this might initially seem circular since the dot product leverages the concept of length. Later frameworks in linear algebra clarify and resolve this apparent circularity.

### Insights on Generalization
1. While the dot product initially appears purely **geometric**, it proves to be a highly versatile tool:
    - Enables computations across more abstract spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^n$).
    - Eliminates dependencies on geometric properties (lengths and angles).
2. **Applications**:
    - Orthogonalization (e.g., Gram-Schmidt process),
    - Defining "coordinate-free" notions of distance and angles in abstract spaces.

---

### Final Takeaway
- The dot product encapsulates essential geometry into a **convenient mathematical combination**.
- Its utility becomes evident:
  - In simplifying computations,
  - In abstracting and generalizing from 2D/3D geometry to higher-dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$.
