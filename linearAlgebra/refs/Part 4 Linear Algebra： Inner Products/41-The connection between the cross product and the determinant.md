## Notes on Determinants and Orthogonality

### 1. Understanding Determinants with Dependent Columns

#### Linear Dependence and Determinants:
- If a matrix has linearly dependent columns (e.g., two columns that are the same), the determinant is 0.

Examples:
1. **Repeating the first column as the third column**:
   - Determinant = 0
2. **Repeating the second column as the third column**:
   - Determinant = 0

#### Conceptual Question:
- Can the determinant be viewed as resembling a dot product?
  - Yes, there are inner product associations within determinants.

### 2. Determinant Calculation: The Cofactor Expansion

#### Indian Approach to Determinants:
- Determinants can be computed using cofactor expansion.

The formula:
$$
\text{determinant} = a \cdot \text{determinant}_{1} - b \cdot \text{determinant}_{2} + c \cdot \text{determinant}_{3}
$$
Where:
- \( a, b, c \) are elements from the first column.
- \( \text{determinant}_1, \text{determinant}_2, \text{determinant}_3 \) are the minor determinants (computed by removing the respective row and column).

#### Association with Orthogonal Vectors:
- The cofactors correspond to a vector orthogonal to the columns of the original matrix.

### 3. Properties of Cofactors and Orthogonality

#### Relation Between Determinants and Orthogonal Vectors:
1. Expand using cofactors:
    - The resulting vector is orthogonal to the original columns.
2. Examples:
    - Adding the vector as a column results in determinant=0, implying orthogonality.

#### Reconstructed Orthogonal Vector:
- The vector derived from cofactors is orthogonal to each column of the matrix.

For instance:
1. Compute determinants:
    - Cofactors are: \( 2, -1, -1 \)
2. Resulting orthogonal vector:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    2 \\
    -1 \\
    -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

### 4. Cross Product Interpretation in 3D:

#### Cross Product Connection:
- The cofactor-derived orthogonal vector corresponds to the cross product in three dimensions.

#### Limitations:
- This approach is specific to 3D geometry.
    - For higher dimensions (\(n > 3\)), cross products or similar constructs donâ€™t directly apply.

Examples:
- Orthogonal vector computed via cofactors (cross product perspective):
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}, 
    \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, 
    \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
    $$

### 5. Recap and Final Points

#### Key Insights:
1. Cofactors and orthogonality:
    - Cofactor expansion produces a vector orthogonal to matrix columns.
2. Cross product interpretation:
    - The derived vector aligns with the cross product in 3D.

#### Practical Importance:
- Determinants and their orthogonal properties are a powerful tool in linear algebra, particularly useful in geometry and vector computations.
