## Eigenvalue Decomposition of a Symmetric Matrix

### Key Observations:
1. The eigenvalues of the matrix can often be deduced by leveraging insights, such as row sums or the trace of the matrix.
2. For symmetric matrices with distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are orthogonal by default but might still need normalization to become orthonormal.

### Example: Eigenvalue Decomposition

Given:
- A symmetric matrix (unspecified in the transcript), the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed step by step.

#### Eigenvalues:
- Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 8$ and $\lambda_2 = 2$.
    - Reasoning:
        - Sum of each row adds up to $8$, so $\lambda_1 = 8$.
        - Total trace = $10$, and since $\text{trace} = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$, $\lambda_2 = 10 - 8 = 2$.
    - Hence, eigenvalues are $8$ and $2$ (or $2$ and $8$, in increasing order).

#### Eigenvectors:
- Corresponding to $\lambda_1 = 8$:
    - Eigenvector: $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
- Corresponding to $\lambda_2 = 2$:
    - Orthogonal to $\mathbf{v}_1$, eigenvector is $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

#### Normalization:
- To make the eigenvectors orthonormal:
    - Normalized $\mathbf{v}_1$: 
      $$
      \mathbf{v}_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
      $$
    - Normalized $\mathbf{v}_2$: 
      $$
      \mathbf{v}_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
      $$

### Decomposition Process:

1. **Matrix Representation Using Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Denote the diagonal eigenvalue matrix by $\Lambda$:
      $$
      \Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} 8 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
      $$
    - Denote the matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors by $P$:
      $$
      P = \begin{bmatrix} 
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
      \end{bmatrix}
      $$

2. **Matrix Decomposition Formula**:
    - The symmetric matrix $A$ can be decomposed as:
      $$
      A = P \Lambda P^T
      $$
      Where $P^T$ is the transpose of $P$.

3. **Matrix Inverse**:
    - Since $P$ has orthonormal columns, $P$ is an orthogonal matrix, making its inverse equal to its transpose:
      $$
      P^{-1} = P^T
      $$

### Important Notes:
- **Orthogonality and Symmetry**:
    - For symmetric matrices, distinct eigenvalues guarantee orthogonal eigenvectors.
    - Normalization is required to make these orthogonal eigenvectors orthonormal.
- **Eigenvector Normalization**:
    - Each vector is divided by its length (e.g., $\sqrt{2}$ in the given example).
- **Symmetry Property**:
    - If the eigenvalue matrix $\Lambda$ and the eigenvector matrix $P$ are constructed such that $P$ includes orthonormal columns, the eigenvalue decomposition maintains the symmetry of the original matrix.

### Final Matrix Representation:
Combining everything:
  $$
  A = P \Lambda P^T = 
  \begin{bmatrix} 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} 8 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
  \end{bmatrix}^T
  $$
