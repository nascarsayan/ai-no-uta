## Understanding Decomposition and Addition in Sound Signals

### Introduction:
- **Addition of Sounds**:
  Sounds are mathematically added together to form a single sum.
  
  **Decomposition**:
  Decomposition is the reverse process where the sum is broken into the individual elements that formed it.

### Decomposition and Your Ear:
- Think of your ear as a **linear algebra machine**:
  - It performs decomposition of the sounds you hear.
  
- Sounds are added together **before entering your ear**:
  - Your ear receives **only the combined signal**.
  - Despite that, you are able to hear the **individual sounds**, showcasing that your ear is an effective decomposition device.

- **A Surprising Fact**:
  Even though information seems lost when we only retain the sum, your ear can still separate individual sounds.

### Why Decomposition Can Fail:
#### Illustration with Example:
Suppose you add single dollar bills and quarters from your drawer:
- **Total Sum**: $100.
- Question: Can you uniquely determine how many single dollar bills and quarters there are?

---

#### Mathematical Analysis:
1. For $s$ single dollar bills and $q$ quarters:
   $$
   s + 0.25q = 100
   $$
   
2. **Infinite Solutions**:
   - $s = 100, q = 0$ (100 single dollar bills, no quarters).
   - $s = 0, q = 400$ (No single dollar bills, 400 quarters).
   - $s = 50, q = 200$ (50 single dollar bills, 200 quarters).
   - Other combinations are possible.
   - Allowing negative numbers or real numbers results in **infinitely many solutions**.

3. **Conclusion**:
   Decomposition is not possible because there isn't a **unique way** to answer the question.

### Sounds vs. Dollars:
- **Dollar Bills**:
  Information is lost when forming the sum due to limited richness of the elements.
  
- **Sounds**:
  - Richness of elements ensures that **information is retained** in the sum.
  - This richness makes decomposition possible for sounds but not for simplistic objects like dollar bills.

---

### Conditions for Decomposition in Linear Algebra:
- **Situations to Study**:
  1. When decomposition is possible **uniquely**.
  2. When decomposition is impossible due to **infinite solutions**.
  3. When decomposition is impossible due to **no solutions**.

---

### Conclusion:
- Signals (like sounds) are intricate and fascinating, retaining essential information during addition.
- The richness of their components ensures meaningful decomposition, unlike simpler numeric operations.
