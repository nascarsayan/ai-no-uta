## Understanding Systems with Varying Variables and Equations 

### Recap of Previous Problems
- Previously, we solved a *tall and narrow system*:
  - **Tall and narrow**: Many equations, few variables.
  - Finding even one solution required us to be very lucky.

### Introducing a New System
- Now, we're analyzing a very different system:
  - **Wide and short**: Few equations, many variables.
  - Example: One equation with five variables (${x, y, z, t, u}$):
    $$
    2x + 5y + 6z + 7t + 241u = 6
    $$
  - This equation seems "silly," but it has educational value in exposing the structure of the system.

## Key Insights into the System Structure

1. **Dimensions and Analysis**:
   - The system features **five variables** but exists in a **one-dimensional space** (due to the single equation).
   - We are guaranteed to have a solution because, in this space, any nonzero column spans the entire space.

2. **Null Space**:
   - With five variables (columns), the system has a **rich null space**.
   - There are **four independent relationships** among these columns, giving rise to a **four-dimensional null space**.

## Solving the System: Particular Solution + General Solution
The general strategy involves:
1. **Finding a Particular Solution**:
   - Choose values to satisfy the equation. 
   - Example 1: Use $x = 3$, $y = 0$, $z = 0$, $t = 0$, $u = 0$:
     $$
     2(3) + 5(0) + 6(0) + 7(0) + 241(0) = 6
     $$
   - This satisfies the equation.

2. **Exploring the Null Space**:
   - For a null space vector, we set the left-hand side of the equation to zero:
     $$
     2x + 5y + 6z + 7t + 241u = 0
     $$
   - Relationships among columns describe the null space.

## Relationships Among the Columns: Null Space Basis

1. **Relationships Between First Two Columns**:
   - Column 2 is $\frac{5}{2}$ times Column 1:
     $$
     5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2} \text{ of Column 1}\right) - \text{Column 2} = 0
     $$
   - This gives a null space vector with values only in the first two columns.

2. **Third Column Relationship**:
   - Column 3 is 3 times Column 1. A null space vector:
     $$
     3 \cdot (\text{Column 1}) - \text{Column 3}
     $$
   - Contributions are isolated to Columns 1 and 3.

3. **Relationship Involving Fourth Column**:
   - Column 4 is $\frac{7}{2}$ times Column 1. Null space vector:
     $$
     7 \cdot (\text{Column 1}) - 2 \cdot (\text{Column 2}) - \text{Column 4}
     $$
   - Example: Use purely integer coefficients for clarity.

4. **Fifth Column Relationship**:
   - Column 5 is $\frac{241}{2}$ of Column 1:
     $$
     241 \cdot (\text{Column 1}) - (\text{Column 5})
     $$

## Finalization: Completing the Null Space

1. **Building a Basis for Null Space**:
   - Each independent relationship among columns corresponds to a dimension in the null space.
   - E.g., Combining integer coefficients to ensure a well-defined basis.

2. **Avoiding Redundancy**:
   - New potential vectors in the null space must represent *independent relationships*.
   - For instance:
     - If Column 6 is proportional to a linear combination of Columns 2 and 3, itâ€™s **already included** in the existing null space basis.

3. **Systematic Approach**:
   - Always relate all columns to the first column for consistency.

## Verification: How to Know a Vector is Already in the Null Space

1. **Intuition**:
   - If relationships between columns are defined (e.g., Column 3 = $k \cdot$ Column 1), then any relationship involving those columns is implied.

2. **Example**: Salary Analogy
   - If Person B earns twice as much as Person A, and Person C earns ten times as much as Person A, then:
     $$
     \text{Person C earns 5 times Person B's salary.}
     $$
   - Similarly, relationships among columns follow automatically.

3. **Formal Verification**:
   - Check if a potential new vector can be written as a combination of existing basis vectors.

## Pending Question: When to Stop Adding Vectors?
- While building the null space, how do we decide when enough vectors have been added to the basis?
- Answer to be discussed further, but redundancy checks (linear independence) provide the key.
