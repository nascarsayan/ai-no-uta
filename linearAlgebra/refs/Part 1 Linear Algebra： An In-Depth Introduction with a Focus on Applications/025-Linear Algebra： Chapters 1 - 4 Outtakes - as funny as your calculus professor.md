## Geometric Vectors and Linear Combinations

### Visualizing Linear Combinations
- **Goal**: Visualize all vectors that can be expressed as a linear combination with coefficients adding up to one.

### Key Concept: Linear Combination
- A **linear combination** is a sum of scalar multiples of vectors.
- Example:
  $$
  c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n \mathbf{v}_n
  $$
  where $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ are scalars, and $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n$ are vectors.

### Scalar Multiplication
- Given a polynomial or vector, multiplying it by a scalar scales all its components proportionally:
  $$
  k \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} k \cdot a \\ k \cdot b \\ k \cdot c \end{bmatrix}
  $$

### Goodbye (Incomplete Concepts)
- Some points in the transcript seem incomplete or nonsensical:
  - E.g., "hello and goodbye," "27 hi sweetie..."
- Likely errors or extraneous text without meaningful contribution to the mathematical discussion.
