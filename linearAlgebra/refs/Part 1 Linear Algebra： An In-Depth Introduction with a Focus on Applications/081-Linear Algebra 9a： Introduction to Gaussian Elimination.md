# Gaussian Elimination

## 1. What is Gaussian Elimination?

- **Gaussian Elimination** is a robust algorithm for solving linear systems.  
- It consists of a **prescribed set of actions** that enable us to systematically determine the solution or conclude that no solution exists.

## 2. Algorithm Definition

- An **algorithm**:
  - Is a **recipe** or **step-by-step process**.
  - Needs to be defined **precisely**, in such a way that:
    1. A computer can execute the steps.
    2. Even someone who doesnâ€™t understand linear systems (e.g., a little sibling) could blindly carry out those actions.
  
- Actions in such algorithms generally include:
  - **Adding numbers**.
  - **Multiplying values**.
  - **Switching numbers**.

### Blind but Functional Execution:
- Algorithms can work blindly without understanding *why* they work or their purpose.
- **However**: It is strongly recommended to understand the reasoning behind the steps.

## 3. Robustness in Mathematics

### Definition of "Robust" Algorithms:
- **Robust algorithms** work under a **wide variety of circumstances**.  
- Example: Solve the simplest linear equation of the form:

$$ 
ax = b 
$$

#### Solution Case:
- If $a \neq 0$, the solution is:  
  $$ 
  x = \frac{b}{a} 
  $$

- However, this solution **fails** when $a = 0$. Additional reasoning is necessary to handle such edge cases.  
- Consequently, this method is **not fully robust**.

#### Robustness of Gaussian Elimination:
- **Gaussian Elimination**:
  - Works in all circumstances.
  - Handles exceptions systematically.
  - Provides either a **general solution** or identifies the absence of a solution.

## 4. What Gaussian Elimination Is NOT

- It **is not** an alternative approach to solving linear systems.  
- Solving linear systems **will always** depend on:
  - Relationships between the **right-hand side vector** and the **columns** of the matrix.
  - Relationship **among columns** of the matrix.

### Purpose of Gaussian Elimination:
- It helps **reveal relationships** within the matrix.
- The method introduces multiple zeros into the matrix, simplifying its structure to make hidden relationships visible.

## 5. Concept Highlights

- **Gaussian Elimination is an enabling tool**:
  - It aids in identifying underlying relationships in linear systems and matrices.
  - It does not take away the need for **insightful problem-solving**.

## 6. Applications and Beauty of Gaussian Elimination

### Why Gaussian Elimination is Exciting:
1. **Robustness**: 
   - Guaranteed success under all circumstances.  
2. **Geometric Insight**:
   - Provides clarity into how relationships in matrices connect algebraically and geometrically.  
3. **Scalability**:
   - Extends to computer applications:
     - Useful not just for small systems like $3 \times 3$ matrices.
     - Can handle matrices as large as $3,000,000 \times 3,000,000$.
   
### Computation Caveats:
- When implemented in computers, Gaussian elimination sometimes **loses robustness** due to computational nuances.  
- Research actively explores ways to regain robustness in large-scale applications.

## 7. Summary Perspective

- Gaussian Elimination may initially seem like a mundane manipulation of numbers, but:
  - It embodies **beauty in its robustness** and systematic structure.
  - It reveals the **geometric and algebraic insights** behind solving linear systems.
  - You may grow to appreciate its elegance and importance.
