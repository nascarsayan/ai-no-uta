## Span and Vector Spaces

### 1. Definition of Span
- **Span**: The set of all possible linear combinations of given vectors.
- Given two vectors $A$ and $B$, the span comprises all vectors that can be written as:
  $$
  \alpha A + \beta B
  $$
  where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary real numbers.

- **Notation**: $\text{span}(A, B)$. If more vectors are involved, list them in parentheses (e.g., $\text{span}(A, B, C)$).

### 2. Properties of the Span
- Linear combinations:
  - The span represents the space in which the given vectors live in.
  - Adding any two vectors in the span produces another vector in the span.
  - Scaling a vector in the span by any real number produces another vector in the span.

- **Subspace**: 
  - The span of a set of vectors is not just a subset, but a legitimate subspace of the vector space.
  - Linear combinations within the span remain in the span.

### 3. Examples of Spans

#### **Two Vectors**
- **Two vectors in space**:
  - If two vectors don't lie along the same line, the span of these vectors forms a plane that includes them. This span includes all points within and outside the angle formed by the vectors, spanning the entire geometric plane they lie in.

- **Two vectors along the same line**:
  - The span reduces to the line on which the vectors lie. No vector outside this line can be generated by linear combinations of the given vectors.

#### **Three Vectors**
- **Three vectors not in the same plane**:
  - The span of these vectors forms the entire 3D space.
  
- **Three vectors in the same plane**:
  - The span is constrained to the plane where these vectors exist.

### 4. Subspace of Quadratic Polynomials
- Span of two polynomials:
  - The span of two quadratic polynomials is some subspace within the space of quadratic polynomials (degrees up to 2).
  - Adding or scaling these polynomials remains within this span.

#### Questions:
- Is the span a proper subspace (not the entire space)?
- Can these polynomials span the entire space of quadratic polynomials?

### 5. Example in $\mathbb{R}^3$
- Consider the span of two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$:
  - If the second entry of both vectors is $0$, then the span is restricted to vectors with the same property.
  - Linear combinations of these vectors cannot break this property, limiting the span to a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

- **Questions**:
  - Can we span all vectors with the middle entry being zero?
  - These questions are answered later in the series.

### 6. General Proof: Span as a Subspace
- **Proof**:
  - Any two vectors in the span of $A$ and $B$ are linear combinations:
    $$
    \alpha_1 A + \beta_1 B \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha_2 A + \beta_2 B
    $$
  
  - Adding these vectors results in:
    $$
    (\alpha_1 A + \beta_1 B) + (\alpha_2 A + \beta_2 B) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)A + (\beta_1 + \beta_2)B
    $$

  - Scaling by a constant $\gamma$:
    $$
    \gamma (\alpha A + \beta B) = (\gamma \alpha) A + (\gamma \beta) B
    $$

  - Therefore:
    - The sum of two vectors in the span remains in the span.
    - Scaling a vector in the span also remains in the span.
    - The span satisfies subspace properties.

### 7. Summary
- Spans are subspaces within vector spaces and preserve linearity.
- The span encapsulates the space generated by all possible linear combinations of given vectors.
