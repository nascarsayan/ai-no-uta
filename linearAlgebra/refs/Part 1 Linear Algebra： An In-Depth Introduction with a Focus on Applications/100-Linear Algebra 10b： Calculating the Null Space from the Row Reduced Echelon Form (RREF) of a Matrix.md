## Row Reduced Echelon Form and the Null Space

### Practical Applications
1. **Primary Application**: 
   - Helps determine the **null space** of a matrix.
   - Assists in solving for **particular solutions** in the context of linear systems.

2. **Why Row Reduced Echelon Form?**
   - It is derived via **Gaussian elimination**, which preserves linear relationships among columns.
   - This ensures the null space of the row-reduced form is identical to that of the original matrix.

### Pivot and Non-Pivot Columns
1. **Key Idea**:
   - Pivot columns represent linearly independent columns.
   - Non-pivot columns contribute to elements in the null space.

2. **Decomposition Using Pivot Columns**:
   - Every non-pivot column can be expressed as a linear combination of pivot columns.

---

### Steps to Determine Null Space
1. Identify **pivot columns** in the row reduced echelon form of the matrix.
2. For each **non-pivot column**, derive an element of the null space by:
   - Writing the non-pivot column as a linear combination of pivot columns.
   - Using this relationship to construct the null space basis.

3. Each non-pivot column contributes one linearly independent vector to the null space.

4. Example construction for specific null space vectors discussed in transcript:
   - For a matrix with **five non-pivot columns**, the null space is five-dimensional.
   - Null space basis vectors are derived systematically using pivot columns.

### Null Space Example
1. **First Null Space Element**: Derived from the first non-pivot column.
   - If twice the first pivot column contributes to the element, construct:
     $$
     \mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
     $$
  
2. **Second Null Space Element**: Derived similarly for the second pivot column.
   - If column relationships imply contributions from multiple columns:
     $$
     \mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
     $$

3. The process is repeated for each non-pivot column, ensuring all elements are systematically related back to the pivot columns.

### Key Observations
1. **Linearly Independent Null Space Elements**:
   - Each non-pivot column guarantees an independent element in the null space.
   - Relationships in the row reduced echelon form simplify identifying these vectors.

2. **Canonical Form**:
   - Representing null space vectors in a canonical form is useful for systematic reasoning and for coding purposes (e.g., in MATLAB or Python).

---

### Total Null Space Dimension
The number of non-pivot columns in the matrix determines the dimension of the null space.

### Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra
1. Relationship Between Column Space and Null Space:
   - $\dim(\text{Column Space}) + \dim(\text{Null Space}) = \text{Number of Columns}$

2. **Impact on Pivot/Non-Pivot Columns**:
   - Pivot columns grow the dimension of the column space.
   - Non-pivot columns augment the null space.

### Precision and Algorithmic Clarity
1. Determining the null space using the row reduced echelon form is:
   - A straightforward, algorithmic task.
   - Easily programmable.
   - Ensures accuracy in output.

2. This approach also clarifies common ambiguities:
   - How to systematically identify all null space relationships.
   - Ensuring null space relationships are independent.

### Conceptual and Practical Highlights
1. **Tutorial Exercise**:
   - Practice finding the null space for different matrices and their row reduced echelon forms to solidify understanding.

2. **Future Topics**:
   - New challenges and applications of the row reduced echelon form, including conceptual gems in linear algebra.
