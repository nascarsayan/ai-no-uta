## 5. Problem Analysis and Gaussian Elimination

This problem is deceptively simple, which may cause some confusion. Letâ€™s analyze the characteristics and relationships among the columns of the matrix and proceed with Gaussian elimination.

### Column Relationships

1. The second column is **twice** the first:
   $$
   \mathbf{c}_2 = 2 \cdot \mathbf{c}_1
   $$

2. The third column is **three times** the first:
   $$
   \mathbf{c}_3 = 3 \cdot \mathbf{c}_1
   $$

3. The right-hand side is **ten times** the first column:
   $$
   \mathbf{b} = 10 \cdot \mathbf{c}_1
   $$

### Observations Before Gaussian Elimination:
- All columns are linearly dependent and have evident scalar relationships with the first column.
- This results in redundancy, making Gaussian elimination straightforward.

### Steps in Gaussian Elimination

1. **Start with eliminating Row 2**:
   - Subtract \( 2 \times \) Row 1 from Row 2:
     $$
     R_2 \to R_2 - 2R_1
     $$
   - This eliminates Row 2 entirely, leaving it as a zero row.

2. **Eliminate Row 3**:
   - Subtract \( 3 \times \) Row 1 from Row 3:
     $$
     R_3 \to R_3 - 3R_1
     $$
   - This also eliminates Row 3 entirely, leaving another zero row.

---

### Final Matrix After Gaussian Elimination:
The matrix ends up with:
- A single non-zero pivot row (Row 1).
- Rows 2 and 3 are zero rows due to linear dependence.

---

### Pivot Columns:
- **Column 1** is the pivot column, as it contains the pivot element.
- **Columns 2 and 3** are not pivot columns because they are linear combinations of Column 1.

---

### General Solution

1. **Right-Hand Side Solution**:
   - Take \( 10 \times \) Row 1:
     $$
     \mathbf{x} = 
     \begin{bmatrix} 
     10 \\ 
     0 \\ 
     0 
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$

2. **Null Space**:
   - The solution space is two-dimensional since Columns 2 and 3 are not pivot columns. The null space basis vectors are:
     $$
     \begin{bmatrix} 
     2 \\ 
     -1 \\ 
     0 
     \end{bmatrix}, 
     \begin{bmatrix} 
     3 \\ 
     0 \\ 
     -1 
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$

   - These vectors acknowledge the relationships:
     - Column 2 is twice Column 1.
     - Column 3 is three times Column 1.

---

### Conclusion

- **Gaussian Elimination** demonstrated all linear dependencies present initially.
- Final observations:
  - The null space is 2D.
  - Relationships among columns were visible from the start and clarified through elimination.
