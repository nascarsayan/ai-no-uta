## Bootstrapping and Decomposition in $\mathbb{R}^3$

### The Bootstrapping Process

1. **Initial Challenge**: Identify which coefficient to determine first.  
   - **Key Insight**: Start with the **third coefficient**, as determining it is the only way to ensure correctness for the **first entry** of the final vector.  
   - Reason: Among the given vectors, **vector $C$** is the only one with a non-zero first entry.

2. **Determining the Third Coefficient**:  
   - Start with vector $C$ and ensure its contribution aligns with the target vector.  
   - Example Calculation:
     $$
     \text{We take 3 times } C. \implies \text{Third coefficient is } 3.
     $$

3. **Next Step**: Identify the **second coefficient**.  
   - Focus is now on the **second entry**.  
   - **Observation**: Only **vector $B$** has a non-zero second entry among the remaining vectors.

4. **Determining the Second Coefficient**:  
   - Contribution from $C$: Since we took $3C$, its contribution to the second entry is $6$.  
   - Target second entry is $5$.  
   - Adjustment using $B$:  
     $$
     6 + (-1 \cdot B) = 5 \implies \text{Second coefficient is } -1.
     $$

5. **Final Step**: Determine the **first coefficient**.  
   - Use the contributions from $C$ and $B$ to adjust for the first entry.  
   - Observe contributions to the first entry:  
     From $C$: $9$ (as $3 \cdot 3 = 9$).  
     From $B$: $1 \cdot (-1) = -1$.  
     Combined contribution is $10$.  
   - Adjust with vector $A$:  
     $$
     10 + (-4 \cdot A) = 6 \implies \text{First coefficient is } -4.
     $$

### Solving Another Decomposition Problem

1. **Focus on First Coefficient**:
   - Target first entry is $8$.  
   - **Take $8C$**, as $C$ is the vector ensuring correctness for the first entry:
     $$
     \text{First coefficient is } 8.
     $$

2. **Determine the Second Coefficient**:  
   - Contribution from $C$: $8 \cdot 2 = 16$.  
   - Target second entry: $-1$.  
   - Adjustment using $B$:  
     $$
     16 + (-27 \cdot B) = -1 \implies \text{Second coefficient is } -27.
     $$

3. **Final Adjustment (Third Coefficient)**:
   - Combined contributions to the third entry:
     - From $C$: $8 \cdot 3 = 24$.  
     - From $B$: $-27 \cdot (-1) = 27$.  
     - Total: $51$.  
   - Target third entry: $17$.  
   - Use $A$ to adjust:  
     $$
     51 - 34 = 17 \implies \text{Third coefficient is } 34.
     $$

### General Takeaways

- **Key Observations**:
  - Decomposition involves systematically choosing coefficients to satisfy each entry of the target vector sequentially.
  - Each step uniquely depends on the vector with a non-zero contribution to the relevant entry.

- **Broader Implications**:
  - This exercise demonstrates the utility of **vector decomposition** in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and more generally, in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  - The decomposition concept directly aligns with solving **linear systems**, as solving a linear system is equivalent to solving a decomposition problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

- **Next Steps**: Transition to **Gaussian Elimination**, which formalizes this process for more complex systems and vectors.
