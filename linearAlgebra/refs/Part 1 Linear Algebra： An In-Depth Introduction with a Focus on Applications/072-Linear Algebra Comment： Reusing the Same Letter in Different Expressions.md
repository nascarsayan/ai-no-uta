## Understanding the Null Space in Linear Algebra

### Setting Up the Discussion

- A question was raised regarding the role of mathematical expressions in linear algebra and their interpretation compared to other areas of mathematics like calculus.
- The topic focuses on understanding **null spaces** and the fundamental differences between expressions and collections of objects like vectors.

### Example Matrix & Null Space Exploration

We start with a **matrix** and examine its **null space**.

#### Observations About the Columns of the Matrix
- The **second column** is the same as the **first column**. This creates a relationship where a vector in the null space is:

    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 \\ 
    0
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- The **third column** is **twice the first column**. This leads to another null space vector:

    $$
    2 \times 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 \\ 
    0
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    2 \\ 
    0
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

#### An Alternate Relationship
- Another relationship that can be observed is that **the third column equals the sum of the first two columns**.
- This produces an alternative null space vector:

    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 \\ 
    1 \\ 
    -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- **Key Insight**: Both expressions describe the same **null space**, even though they differ stylistically.

### Equivalence of Different Expressions

#### Equivalence Explained
- The null space can be expressed in multiple ways mathematically. For instance:

    $$
    \alpha \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 \\ 
    0
    \end{bmatrix} +
    \beta \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 
    0 \\ 
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    And alternatively:

    $$
    \alpha' \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 \\ 
    1 \\ 
    -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- These expressions are **equivalent** because they represent the same collection of vectors within the null space.

#### Example
- Setting $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = 1$ in one expression yields the vector $[3, -1, -1]$.
- Setting $\alpha' = 2$, $\beta' = 1$ in the second expression can yield **the same vector**.
- Importantly, while the coefficients may differ across forms, the **vectors represented are identical**.

#### Clarification on Symbol Overlap
- A common question: Should different coefficients (e.g., $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$) be labeled to avoid confusion?
    - Answer: The coefficients, $\alpha, \beta$, represent **all possible real numbers**. There’s no actual overlap or "mixing" because they span the same set of possibilities.

### Null Space: **Not** an Expression, But a Collection

- **Important Concept**: The null space is **not** an expression; it is a **collection of vectors**.

    - Example:

        - One vector: $[3, -1, -1]$.
        - Another vector: Letting $\alpha = 10, \beta = 1$, yields $[12, -10, -1]$.

    - It would be impractical to list infinitely many vectors directly. Using an **expression** is a concise way to capture the set.

    - Example of an expression representing the null space:

        $$
        \alpha \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} + 
        \beta \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
        $$

### Broader Lessons in Linear Algebra

#### Linear Algebra vs. Calculus
- In **calculus**, emphasis is often placed on **manipulating expressions** and deriving equivalent expressions.
- In **linear algebra**, the focus is on understanding **concepts and objects** (like vectors, spaces) *behind* the expressions.

#### Practical Tip
- When encountering an expression in linear algebra, ask:
    - **What does this expression represent?**
    - Think not just about the algebra itself, but about the geometric or conceptual meaning.

#### Summary About the Null Space
- The null space is a **collection** of vectors that can be represented by different equivalent expressions.
- The specifics of the coefficients ($\alpha, \beta$) don’t matter individually; they span all possible real numbers, guaranteeing no "clash" between expressions.

### Conclusion

The lesson here is less about specific mathematical manipulations and more about understanding the **structure** and **meaning** behind the numbers and expressions in linear algebra. This relational perspective separates linear algebra from calculus, highlighting its central focus on collections, spaces, and equivalence.
