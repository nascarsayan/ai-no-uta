# Structured Notes: Null Space and Column Space

## 1. Null Space vs. Column Space

- Null space and column space are **completely different concepts**, though often confused due to:
  - Similar names.
  - Introduction at the same time in linear systems.
  - Both being unlike anything most students have encountered.

### Key Hint for Differentiating:
- Pick a **rectangular matrix** (e.g., $2 \times 4$) to visualize the difference. Square matrices make null space and column space appear more similar and harder to distinguish.

---

## 2. Column Space

### Definition:
- **Column space** is defined as the vector space formed by **linear combinations of the columns**.
- **Hint from the name**: Column space consists of vectors that live in the same space as the **columns**.

### Example with Dimensions:
- For a $2 \times 4$ matrix:
  - The **column space** lives in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  - The columns are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

---

## 3. Null Space

### Definition:
- **Null space** consists of all the vectors $x$ such that $Ax = 0$, where $A$ is the matrix in question.
- Null space captures **relationships among the columns**, not the columns themselves.
- Null space **lives in $\mathbb{R}^n$**, where $n$ is the number of columns in the matrix $A$.

### Example with Dimensions:
- For the same $2 \times 4$ matrix:
  - **Null space** lives in $\mathbb{R}^4$ (dimension based on columns).

---

### Key Differences:
1. **Column Space**:
   - Focus: Linear combinations of columns themselves.
   - Lives in: $\mathbb{R}^m$, where $m$ is the number of rows.
   
2. **Null Space**:
   - Focus: Coefficients of linear combinations producing zero.
   - Lives in: $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the number of columns.

## 4. Applications in Linear Systems

- Linear systems can be interpreted as **decomposition problems**:
  - The **column space** answers **existence** of solutions (whether the right-hand side is in the column space).
  - The **null space** answers **uniqueness** of solutions (whether there are multiple solutions, and captures all possible solutions).

### Example: Decomposition
- A system $Ax = b$ is solvable if $b$ is in the **column space** of $A$.
- If $b$ is not in the column space, no solution exists.

## 5. Example Matrix Scenarios

### 2x4 Rectangular Matrix:

#### Column Space Example:
The columns of a $2 \times 4$ matrix might span:
- Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- For example:
  $$
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
  2 & 4 & 6 & 8 
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  - Column space: Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

#### Null Space:
- Null space consists of combinations of the 4 columns (relationships that produce $0$):
  $$
  A \cdot x = \mathbf{0}.
  $$

#### Null Space Example:
- If one column is a multiple of another (e.g., two columns are linearly dependent), the null space isn't trivial.

---

### 3x3 Square Matrix:

A more confusing example:

#### Matrix:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 15
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
- Null space focuses on relationships like adding/subtracting columns.
- Column space focuses on possible outputs (linear combinations of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$).

#### Null Space:
- Example: If the last column is a sum of the first two, the null space accounts for $x$ values that create this relationship.

#### Column Space:
- Includes vectors that can be written as:
  $$
  \text{span}\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\4\\7\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}2\\5\\8\end{bmatrix}\right).
  $$

## 6. Intuitive Summary: Purpose

### Column Space:
- Purpose:
  - Determine whether the right-hand side $b$ is feasible (does $b$ live in the column space?).
- Applications:
  - Solves **existence of solution** in linear systems.

---

### Null Space:
- Purpose:
  - Determine if the solution is **unique**, and capture all possible solutions.
- Applications:
  - Describes flexibility in solving $Ax = 0$.

---

## 7. Key Properties of Column and Null Spaces

### Dimensions Relationship:
- For a matrix $A$ ($m \times n$):
  $$
  \text{dim}(\text{null space}) + \text{dim}(\text{column space}) = n.
  $$

## 8. Final Takeaways

- Remember the distinct purposes:
  - **Column space**: What outputs (vectors) can be generated by linear combinations of columns.
  - **Null space**: What inputs (linear relationships among columns) collapse to zero.
- Focus on:
  1. **Purpose**.
  2. **Dimension** (column space: $\mathbb{R}^m$, null space: $\mathbb{R}^n$).
  3. **Name** (describes their role explicitly).
