# Linear Systems Analysis: Dimensions, Solutions, and Null Space

## 1. Overview
This transcript addresses key concepts related to:
- Solving systems of linear equations.
- Understanding dimensions.
- Exploring the null space and linear independence.
- The geometric analogy of vectors in multi-dimensional spaces.

---

## 2. Problem Setup
The system being analyzed has:
- **2 unknowns**, and
- **4 equations**.

Questions posed:
1. Is it likely for such a system to have a solution, given that 2 unknowns (2 degrees of freedom) must satisfy 4 conditions?
2. What does the null space of this system indicate about linear independence and solutions?

---

## 3. Key Discussion Points

### 3.1. Likelihood of Solutions
- With **2 unknowns** (degrees of freedom) attempting to satisfy **4 equations**, it is **unlikely** for a solution to exist.
- Perspective:
    - **Equation-space view:** Constraints likely over-constrain the system.
    - **Vector-space view:** Two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$ span a plane, reducing chances for arbitrary right-hand side alignment.

---

## 4. Particular Solution
- Observation: The solution is **1, 1**.
- Steps:
    - Decompose the right-hand side as a linear combination of the columns.
    - Direct computation shows that the right-hand side is the sum of two columns.

$$
1 \cdot \text{Column}_1 + 1 \cdot \text{Column}_2 = \text{Right-hand side}.
$$

Thus, the **particular solution** is:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

## 5. Null Space Analysis

### 5.1. Null Space Properties
**Definition:** The null space (or kernel) of a matrix is the set of all vectors $\mathbf{x}$ such that $A\mathbf{x} = 0$.

- In this case:
    1. The **trivial null space** contains only the **zero vector**.
    2. Formal representation:
       $$
       \text{Null space} = \{ \mathbf{0} \}.
       $$
    3. Null space properties:
        - A **non-empty null space** usually implies linear dependence.
        - Here, the null space being trivial reflects **linear independence** of columns.

---

### 5.2. Linear Independence
To classify two vectors as **linearly independent**, one must not be a scalar multiple of the other.

#### Example of Dependence:
- If $\text{Column}_2$ were a scalar multiple of $\text{Column}_1$:
    $$
    \text{Column}_2 = k \cdot \text{Column}_1.
    $$
- This would lead to non-trivial solutions in the null space.

#### Current Case:
- **No scalar multiple relationship** between the columns confirms:
    - **Linear Independence**.
    - **Unique solution** for the system.

## 6. Geometric Analogy
### 6.1. $\mathbb{R}^4$ and Planes
- The two columns (vectors) reside in a **4-dimensional space ($\mathbb{R}^4$)**.
- With **2 vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$**, they span a **2D plane**.
    - Any vector outside this plane **cannot** be represented as a linear combination of the columns.

### 6.2. Reduced-Dimension Insights
Using a lower-dimensional analogy:
1. **2 vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$:** Span a **plane**.
2. A random **right-hand side vector** outside the plane is unlikely to be expressible as a linear combination of the columns.

Hence:
- Similarly, in $\mathbb{R}^4$, itâ€™s unlikely for a random vector (right-hand side) to align with the plane defined by two vectors (columns).

---

## 7. System Insights
### 7.1. System as Written
- **Original system:** The right-hand side lies in the column space.
    - This allowed for the existence of a particular solution (1, 1).
  
### 7.2. Modifications
- If the right-hand side is altered (e.g., arbitrary modification), the likelihood decreases.
- Example:
  - Changing the third entry of the right-hand side to 9 instead of 59:
    - No linear combination can reproduce the altered vector.

---

## 8. Null Space and Uniqueness
### 8.1. Trivial Null Space
- A **trivial null space** signifies that the decomposition (or solution) is **unique**.

### 8.2. Implication for Solution
- Adding the **zero vector** (from null space) to the particular solution yields no change.
- Thus:
    $$
    \mathbf{x} = \text{unique}.
    $$

---

## 9. Conclusion
### 9.1. When does a solution exist?
- Systems with two vectors in a high-dimensional space are **very unlikely** to have a solution for a generalized right-hand side.

### 9.2. Solving the system
- Original system solution: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
- Modified systems may fail due to misalignment of the right-hand side with the column space.
