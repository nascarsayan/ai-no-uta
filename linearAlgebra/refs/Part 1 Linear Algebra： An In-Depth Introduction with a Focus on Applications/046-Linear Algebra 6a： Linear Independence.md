## Linear Independence  

### The Concept of Linear Independence  
- Linear independence is a central concept in linear algebra.  
- It serves as a foundation for many subsequent topics and discussions in the subject.  

### Motivation Through an Example  

**Given**: Three vectors $A$, $B$, and $C$.  
**Task**: Decompose a vector $D$ as a linear combination of $A$, $B$, and $C$.  

#### Observation  
- Unlike previous examples, here multiple solutions exist.  
- Let's explore several possible decompositions:  

1. **First Decomposition**:  
   Taking advantage of the right angle between $A$ and $B$:  
   $$
   D = 2A + B
   $$
   - None of $C$ is involved.  

2. **Second Decomposition**:  
   Using vectors $A$ and $C$:  
   $$
   D = A + C
   $$
   - None of $B$ is involved.  

3. **Third Decomposition**:  
   Using $C$ and $-B$:  
   $$
   D = 2C - B
   $$
   - None of $A$ is involved.  

4. **Fourth Decomposition (General)**:  
   By noticing patterns, we can create infinitely many decompositions, such as:  
   $$
   D = -A - 2B + 3C
   $$  

#### Why are there infinitely many decompositions?  
- The relationship between $A$, $B$, and $C$ allows this flexibility.  
- Specifically:  
  $$
  C = A + B
  $$
  - This means $C$ is not independent of $A$ and $B$.  

### Key Insight  
- Whenever there is a relationship among vectors, we can replace part of one combination with another vector.  
- For example, replacing $A + B$ in a combination with $C$ allows us to generate new decompositions.

## Definitions  

### Linearly Dependent Vectors  
- A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.  

#### Example:  
- Vectors $A$, $B$, and $C$ are linearly dependent because:  
  $$
  C = A + B
  $$  
- Similarly:  
  - $A$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $B$ and $C$.  
  - $B$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $A$ and $C$.  

### Linearly Independent Vectors  
- A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if none of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.  

#### Formally:  
- For a set of vectors $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$, they are linearly independent if:  
  $$
  c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \dots + c_nv_n = 0
  $$  
  implies $c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_n = 0$.

## Interplay Between Algebra and Geometry  

- The geometrical interpretation revealed multiple decompositions easily.  
- However, the algebraic relationship showed how infinitely many decompositions could be derived.  
- **Insight**: The combination of algebra and geometry creates a powerful framework for understanding and reasoning about problems in linear algebra.

## Linear Dependence and Independence in Context  

- Linearly dependent sets always have relationships among their vectors.  
- Linearly independent sets have no such relationships, providing a foundation for identifying "irreducible" sets of vectors in vector spaces.

## What's Next?  

- Exploring all possible linear combinations of $A$, $B$, and $C$ that produce $D$.  
- Deriving an alternative definition of linear dependence and independence through mathematical expressions.
