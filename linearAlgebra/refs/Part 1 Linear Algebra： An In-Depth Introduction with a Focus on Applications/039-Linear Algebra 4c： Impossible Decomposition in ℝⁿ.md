## Impossible Decomposition Problems in $\mathbb{R}^n$

### Key Notes:
- The focus is on treating elements in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as abstract sets of numbers rather than associating them with geometric vectors.
- Concepts to keep in mind:
  - **Numbers as entries**: When dealing with $\mathbb{R}^n$, we examine relationships among the entries, rather than geometric interpretations.
  - Avoid associating vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^3$) with traditional "geometric vectors" unless explicitly required. This helps align with the core principles of linear algebra.

### Example 1: First Decomposition Problem

#### Problem Setup:
- Given a set of basis vectors where the **middle entry** is always $0$, determine if a target vector can be expressed as their linear combination.

#### Solution:
1. _Observation_:
    - The middle entry of the decomposition vectors is $0$.
    - If you add two such vectors, the resulting vector also has $0$ as its middle entry:
      $$
      \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ 0 \\ b_1 \end{bmatrix} 
      + \begin{bmatrix} a_2 \\ 0 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix} 
      = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + a_2 \\ 0 \\ b_1 + b_2 \end{bmatrix}
      $$
    - Similarly, scalar multiplication preserves this property:
      $$
      k \times \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 0 \\ b \end{bmatrix}
      = \begin{bmatrix} ka \\ 0 \\ kb \end{bmatrix}.
      $$
    - Thus, **any linear combination** of the given vectors will also have $0$ as the middle entry.
      
2. _Target Vector Check_:
    - The target vector has a non-zero middle entry (e.g., $4$), so it **cannot** be expressed as a linear combination of the given vectors.

#### Conclusion:
The middle entry property makes it impossible to decompose the target vector.

### Example 2: Second Decomposition Problem

#### Problem Setup:
- Basis vectors have the property: **second entry = $5 \times$ (first entry)}.
- Determine if a target vector can be represented as their linear combination.

#### Solution:
1. _Observation_:
    - The second entry of each basis vector follows the relationship: $b = 5a$:
      $$
      \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ 5a_1 \\ c_1 \end{bmatrix} 
      + \begin{bmatrix} a_2 \\ 5a_2 \\ c_2 \end{bmatrix}
      = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + a_2 \\ 5(a_1 + a_2) \\ c_1 + c_2 \end{bmatrix}.
      $$
    - Scalar multiplication preserves the property:
      $$
      k \times \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 5a \\ c \end{bmatrix}
      = \begin{bmatrix} ka \\ 5(ka) \\ kc \end{bmatrix}.
      $$
    - Therefore, any linear combination of these vectors will also have the property: $b = 5a$.
      
2. _Target Vector Check_:
    - Check whether the target vector satisfies the $b = 5a$ property.
    - If not, it **cannot** be expressed as a linear combination of the given basis vectors.

#### Conclusion:
The linear combination restriction ($b = 5a$) renders the target vector representation impossible.

### Example 3: Third Decomposition Problem

#### Problem Setup:
- Basis vectors have the property: **middle entry = average of the first and third entries**.
- Determine if a target vector satisfies this property.

#### Solution:
1. _Observation_: 
    - For each basis vector:
      $$
      b = \frac{a + c}{2}.
      $$
    - Adding two such vectors preserves the property:
      $$
      \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \frac{a_1 + c_1}{2} \\ c_1 \end{bmatrix}
      + \begin{bmatrix} a_2 \\ \frac{a_2 + c_2}{2} \\ c_2 \end{bmatrix}
      = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + a_2 \\ \frac{(a_1 + a_2) + (c_1 + c_2)}{2} \\ c_1 + c_2 \end{bmatrix}.
      $$
    - Scalar multiplication also preserves the property:
      $$
      k \times \begin{bmatrix} a \\ \frac{a + c}{2} \\ c \end{bmatrix}
      = \begin{bmatrix} ka \\ \frac{ka + kc}{2} \\ kc \end{bmatrix}.
      $$
    - Thus, any linear combination of these vectors will have the **average property** for the middle entry.

2. _Target Vector Check_:
    - If the target vector's middle entry is not the average of its first and third entries, it is **not decomposable** using the given basis vectors:
      $$
      \text{Target vector does not satisfy: } b = \frac{a + c}{2}.
      $$

#### Conclusion:
The "average condition" makes it impossible to represent the target vector as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

### Summary

- Each decomposition problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$ was solved by identifying a key **preserved property** among the given basis vectors:
  1. First decomposition: **Middle entry = $0$**.
  2. Second decomposition: **Second entry = $5 \times$ (First entry)}**.
  3. Third decomposition: **Middle entry = average of first and third entries**.
- If the target vector violates these properties, it **cannot** be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
