## Null Space of a Matrix

### Revisiting the Concept of Null Space

- The null space represents a set of vectors.
- In a previous example, four geometric vectors \( A, B, C, D \) were analyzed.
- These vectors were shown to be **linearly dependent** in multiple ways:
    - \( B = A + C \)
    - \( D = C - A \)

### Relationships Between Vectors

- The dependencies can be expressed algebraically:
    $$
    A - B + C = 0
    $$
    - Here, the coefficients are arranged in **alphabetical order**: \( A, B, C, D \).
    - Coefficients: \( 1, -1, 1, 0 \).
    - This forms the **first element** of the null space.

- Another relationship:
    $$
    A - C + D = 0
    $$
    - Coefficients: \( 1, 0, -1, 1 \).
    - This forms the **second element** of the null space.

### Null Space of a Matrix

- To find the null space of a matrix, think of its **columns as vectors**.
- Each column of the matrix represents a vector in a higher-dimensional space (e.g., \( \mathbb{R}^4 \)).
  
#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. Identify the relationships among the columns of the matrix.
2. Rewrite these relationships as **linear combinations** that equal zero.
3. Organize the coefficients from these combinations into vectors.

#### Example with Column Vectors \( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4 \):
- Observing relationships:
    - \( C_2 = C_1 + C_3 \):
        $$
        C_1 - C_2 + C_3 = 0
        $$
        Coefficients: \( 1, -1, 1, 0 \).

    - \( C_4 = C_3 - C_1 \):
        $$
        C_1 - C_3 + C_4 = 0
        $$
        Coefficients: \( 1, 0, -1, 1 \).

#### Null Space Representation:
- The null space consists of **two vectors**:
    1. \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \)
    2. \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

### General Observations:
- The null space captures all **linear dependencies** among the column vectors.
- Any **linear combination** of these basis vectors in the null space remains in the null space.

### Key Insights

1. **Null Space and Matrices**:
   - A matrix can be thought of as a collection of column vectors.
   - Finding the null space involves discovering their dependencies.

2. **Dimensionality**:
   - If the matrix has \( n \) columns, the null space lives in a space like \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

3. **Null Space in Linear Systems**:
   - When solving systems of linear equations, the concept of null space emerges naturally.

4. **Importance in Linear Algebra**:
   - Null space connects the geometric representation of vectors with the algebraic framework of matrices.
   - It represents the solutions to \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \), where \( \mathbf{x} \) is in the null space of matrix \( A \).
