## Polynomial Decomposition

### Differences Between Polynomials and Geometric Vectors
- Polynomials differ significantly from geometric vectors.
- These two types of vectors are conceptually distinct:
  - Geometric vectors often rely on spatial or visual intuition.
  - Polynomials are functions, requiring analytical methods for analysis.
- Despite these differences, the concept of **decomposition** applies to both.

### Decomposition: General Idea
1. The task in decomposition is to determine the **unknown coefficients** in a **linear combination** of vectors.
2. This concept extends universally to:
   - Geometric vectors
   - Polynomials
   - Other kinds of vectors
3. While the goal remains the same, the approach differs due to the nature of the underlying objects:
   - **Geometric vectors:** Rely on geometric imagination and intuition.
   - **Polynomials (functions):** Rely on analytical tools for solutions.

### Example: Decomposition of a Polynomial
#### Problem
Decompose $x^2 + 7x + 5$ with respect to three polynomials $p_1(x), p_2(x), p_3(x)$:
- $p_1(x) = x^2$
- $p_2(x) = 3x$
- $p_3(x) = 1$

#### Solution
1. Start by matching **$x^2$**:
   - $x^2$ only appears in $p_1(x)$.
   - To match the coefficient of 1, we take exactly **1 unit of $p_1$**:
     $$
     c_1 = 1
     $$

2. Match **$x$**:
   - $x$ only appears in $p_2(x) = 3x$.
   - To match the coefficient of 7, we take $\frac{7}{3}$ units of $p_2$:
     $$
     c_2 = \frac{7}{3}
     $$

3. Match the **constant** term (5):
   - Constants only appear in $p_3(x) = 1$.
   - To match the coefficient of 5, we take exactly **5 units of $p_3$**:
     $$
     c_3 = 5
     $$

The complete decomposition is:
$$
x^2 + 7x + 5 = 1 \cdot p_1(x) + \frac{7}{3} \cdot p_2(x) + 5 \cdot p_3(x)
$$

### Example 2: Decomposition of Another Polynomial
#### Problem
Decompose $x^2 - 7x$ with respect to the same polynomials $p_1(x), p_2(x), p_3(x)$:
- $p_1(x) = x^2$
- $p_2(x) = 3x$
- $p_3(x) = 1$

#### Solution
1. Start by matching **$x^2$**:
   - $x^2$ only appears in $p_1(x)$.
   - To match the coefficient of 1, we take exactly **1 unit of $p_1$**:
     $$
     c_1 = 1
     $$

2. Match **$x$**:
   - $x$ only appears in $p_2(x) = 3x$.
   - To match the coefficient of $-7$, we take $-\frac{7}{3}$ units of $p_2$:
     $$
     c_2 = -\frac{7}{3}
     $$

3. Match the **constant** term:
   - There is no constant term in the polynomial.
   - Hence, we take **0 units of $p_3$**:
     $$
     c_3 = 0
     $$

The complete decomposition is:
$$
x^2 - 7x = 1 \cdot p_1(x) - \frac{7}{3} \cdot p_2(x) + 0 \cdot p_3(x)
$$

### Key Takeaways
- **Linearity:** Decomposition problems rely on the principle of linearity, making them applicable across various vector spaces (e.g., geometric vectors, polynomials).
- **Framework of Linear Algebra:** Linear algebra offers a **common framework** to analyze and decompose a wide variety of objects, even those as distinct as functions and spatial vectors.
- While the strategy for solving decomposition remains consistent, the **tools and intuition** vary based on the type of vector.

### Next Steps
- In the next discussion, we will consider more complex polynomials and decomposition problems.
- This will introduce:
  - Greater challenges in finding coefficients.
  - New questions about the complexity of the basis vectors (polynomials).
  - Exploration of systematic methods to solve such problems.
