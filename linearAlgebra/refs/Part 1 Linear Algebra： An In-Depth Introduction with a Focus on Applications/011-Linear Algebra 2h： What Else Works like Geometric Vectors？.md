## 1. Understanding Geometric Vectors

### Displacement and Geometric Vectors
- Displacements or relative locations between points are intuitive representations of geometric vectors.
- Rules for adding vectors and scalar multiplication are derived from displacements.
- Fundamental question: **What other objects behave like geometric vectors?**

---

## 2. Sequential and Concurrent Journeys

### Sequential Journeys
- Displacements (or journeys) are often visualized sequentially:
    - Start at a point, undergo \( \text{Journey}_1 \), and end at a new position after \( \text{Journey}_2 \).
    - The **net displacement** is the geometric sum of the individual journeys using the **tip-to-tail rule**.

### Concurrent Displacements
- Example: A train and a ladybug illustrate concurrent displacements:
    1. **Train Displacement**: Moving 60 miles in 1 hour.
    2. **Ladybug Displacement** (train frame): Crawling 60 miles on the train in 1 hour.
    3. **Net Displacement**: Sum of the train's and ladybug's displacements relative to a stationary frame.

#### Key Equation:
- The net displacement vector \( \vec{D} \) can be expressed as:
  $$ 
  \vec{D} = \vec{B} + \vec{C}
  $$
  where:
  - \( \vec{B} \): Displacement of the ladybug relative to the train.
  - \( \vec{C} \): Displacement of the train relative to the stationary frame.

- The **tip-to-tail rule** holds true for concurrent displacements.

## 3. Velocity and Vector Addition

### Velocity as a Vector
- Velocity is derived from displacement as:
  $$ 
  \vec{v} = \frac{\vec{D}}{t}
  $$
  where \( t \) is the elapsed time.

### Concurrent Velocities
- The velocities align similarly to displacements:
  $$ 
  \vec{v}_{\text{ladybug}} = \vec{v}_{\text{relative}} + \vec{v}_{\text{train}}
  $$
  where:
  - \( \vec{v}_{\text{ladybug}} \): Net velocity of the ladybug relative to the stationary frame.
  - \( \vec{v}_{\text{relative}} = \frac{\vec{B}}{t} \): Velocity of the ladybug relative to the train.
  - \( \vec{v}_{\text{train}} = \frac{\vec{C}}{t} \): Velocity of the train relative to the stationary frame.

#### Distributive Property:
- Velocity addition can be derived algebraically:
  $$ 
  \vec{v}_{\text{ladybug}} = \frac{\vec{B} + \vec{C}}{t} = \frac{\vec{B}}{t} + \frac{\vec{C}}{t}
  $$

- **Velocities add up just as displacement vectors do.**

## 4. Acceleration and Geometric Vectors

### Acceleration as a Vector
- Acceleration is defined as:
  $$ 
  \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
  $$
  Provided velocities change uniformly, accelerations also behave as vectors.

### Key Idea:
- Acceleration obeys the same rules for addition and scalar multiplication as geometric vectors.

---

## 5. Forces and Newton's Second Law

### Force as a Vector
- Newton's Second Law:
  $$ 
  \vec{F} = m \vec{a}
  $$
  - Net force \( \vec{F} \): Resultant of all forces acting on a body.
  - Acceleration \( \vec{a} \): Already established as a vector.
  - Mass \( m \): Scalar.

### Vector Nature of Forces
- Forces are vector quantities because they act with both magnitude and direction.
- Net force is calculated using the **parallelogram rule**:
  - For example, if a body is subjected to multiple forces, their vector sum (according to the parallelogram law) determines the net force.

#### Historical Context:
- Newton postulated that forces add like geometric vectorsâ€”this was an assumption, not derived from earlier principles.
- The rule for addition of forces is fundamental: forces obey the **same rules as geometric vectors**.

---

## 6. Summary of Vector-Like Quantities

### Behavior of Different Quantities
- Displacements, velocities, accelerations, and forces act like geometric vectors.
- They obey:
  - **Addition**: Tip-to-tail or parallelogram rule.
  - **Multiplication by Scalars**: Proportional stretching or shrinking based on scalars.

### Historical Insight
- The development of geometric vectors and their application to physical quantities like force, velocity, and acceleration required significant intellectual effort. 
- Modern understanding simplifies these concepts but is built on foundational work like Newton's contributions.
