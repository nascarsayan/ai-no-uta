## Expression of a Straight Line Not Passing Through the Origin

### Purpose of the Discussion
- To express a straight line that does not pass through the origin as a linear combination of vectors.
- **Geometric to Algebraic Translation**: Find an algebraic expression for a geometric object.

#### Two-Fold Purpose:
1. Illustrating the bond between **algebra** and **geometry**:
   - Some problems are easier from a **geometric** perspective; others from an **algebraic** perspective.
   - Combining the two is more powerful than treating them separately.
2. Providing intuition for **solutions of linear systems**:
   - Solutions of linear systems are analogous to straight lines and planes that do not pass through the origin.

### Approach
1. **Parallel Vector**:
    - Draw a vector parallel to the straight line and label it $\mathbf{A}$.
    - Different multiples of $\mathbf{A}$ correspond to moving along the line:
      $1\mathbf{A}$, $2\mathbf{A}$, $3\mathbf{A}$, $-1\mathbf{A}$, etc.
    - These vectors only move parallel to the line but do not land on it.

    $$
    \text{Movement along the straight line: } \alpha \mathbf{A}, \text{ where } \alpha \in \mathbb{R}.
    $$

2. **Base Vector**:
    - Add a vector $\mathbf{B}$ going to a point on the line.
    - Combine $\mathbf{B}$ with $\alpha \mathbf{A}$ to land on the line.

      $$
      \text{Straight line equation: } \mathbf{B} + \alpha \mathbf{A}.
      $$
    - Varying $\alpha$ gives the full set of points on the line.

### Mathematical Representation of the Line
The straight line is given by:
$$
\mathbf{B} + \alpha \mathbf{A}, \quad \alpha \in \mathbb{R}.
$$
#### Key Observations:
- **Interpretation of $\alpha$**:
  - $\alpha = 0$: Position is at $\mathbf{B}$.
  - $\alpha = 1$: Position is $\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}$.
  - $\alpha = -1$: Position is $\mathbf{B} - \mathbf{A}$, and so forth.

#### Why is it **not a subspace**?
- The straight line does not pass through the origin (a requirement for a subspace).

### Alternative Representations
- **Different Base Vectors**:
    - Instead of $\mathbf{B}$, use another vector $\mathbf{C}$ on the same line:
      $$
      \mathbf{C} + \alpha \mathbf{A}.
      $$
- **Different Parallel Vectors**:
    - Replace $\mathbf{A}$ with another vector $\mathbf{D}$ parallel to the line:
      $$
      \mathbf{C} + \alpha \mathbf{D}, \quad \text{or } \mathbf{B} + \alpha \mathbf{D}.
      $$
- **Other Directions**:
    - Consider opposite directions or scales for the parallel vector:
      $$
      \mathbf{C} - \alpha \mathbf{D}, \quad \text{or } \mathbf{C} + 11\alpha \mathbf{D}.
      $$

#### Infinite Representation Possibilities:
- Any vector starting on the line can serve as the base.
- Any vector parallel to the line can serve as the directional vector.

### Key Concept: Set of Vectors
- The expression $\mathbf{B} + \alpha \mathbf{A}$ (or variants) represents the **set of vectors** that form the straight line:
    - It's not the specific expression but the **set of vectors** that matters.
    - Visualize the **geometric meaning** of the set behind the expression.

---

### How This Differs from Calculus
- **Linear Algebra**:
    - Focuses on the **set of vectors** behind expressions.
    - There are infinitely many equivalent expressions for the same set.
    - All representations are correct as long as they describe the same line.
- **Calculus**:
    - Focuses on the **expression itself** as the answer.
    - Equivalent expressions (e.g., $2\sin x \cos x$ and $\sin 2x$) represent the same **function**, so they are interchangeable.

### Implication for Linear Systems
- Capturing solutions geometrically:
    - Analogous to representing broad sets of vectors (e.g., lines or planes) with algebraic expressions.
    - Intuition for solving linear systems arises from understanding these expressions and the sets they represent.
