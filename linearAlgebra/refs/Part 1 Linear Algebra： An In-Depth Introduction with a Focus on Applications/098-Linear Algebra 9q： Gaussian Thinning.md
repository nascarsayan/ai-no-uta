# Gaussian Thinning and Null Space

## Introduction
- The topic of discussion is **Gaussian thinning** as opposed to Gaussian elimination.
- Gaussian thinning focuses on simplifying linear systems only as much as needed, rather than fully reducing them.

---

## Key Idea: Stop Reduction When Necessary
- When analyzing linear systems by hand:
  - Full Gaussian elimination is not always required.
  - You should take elimination only as far as necessary.
- Example: Determining the **null space** of a matrix.

## Example: Null Space of a Matrix
Consider the problem of determining the null space of a matrix.

### Observations:
- The last entry in each column is the sum of the first two, meaning the columns are **linearly dependent**.
- Therefore, the null space is **non-trivial**.
- A single step of Gaussian elimination will reveal the structure of the null space.

## Process: Use Gaussian Thinning

1. **Choose a Pivot:**
   - Use a convenient pivot (e.g., the entry in the first column).

2. **Eliminate Large Numbers:**
   - Subtract multiples of the pivot row from other rows to eliminate key entries.

3. **Stop When Insights Are Gained:**
   - Donâ€™t fully reduce the matrix; stop when sufficient linear dependencies (e.g., rows of zeros) are apparent.

## Analysis of the Null Space

1. After partial Gaussian elimination:
   - You achieve a row of zeros.
   - The matrix form at this stage provides enough information to deduce the null space.
   
2. **Key Equations:**
   - Relationships between columns emerge:
   
   $$
   \text{Null space relies on coefficients forming a linear combination that produces zeros.}
   $$

---

## Result: Null Space Determination
- By analyzing the reduced matrix:
  - Use the structure of zeros and relationships to determine the null space.
  - Specific examples show that:
  
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    &\text{Switching numbers, changing signs, and combining columns yields:}\\
    &\quad \text{null space coefficients forming a solution.}
    \end{align*}
    $$

## Conclusion

- Gaussian elimination is **powerful** but not always practical for all steps.
- Adopt **Gaussian thinning** when solving systems by hand:
  - Simplify as needed.
  - Avoid unnecessary computations.
- The null space, while seemingly complex, can often be deduced with just a few key steps of elimination.
