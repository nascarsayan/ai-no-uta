## The Null Space and Linear Dependence

### Introduction to the Null Space  
- Linear dependence means one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the rest.  
- This can be rewritten as a **non-trivial linear combination** that equals $0$.  
- The null space is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that captures these relationships.

### Relationships Between Vectors  
1. **Example Relationships:**
   - $b = a + c$
   - $d = c - a$
   - $c = \frac{b + d}{2}$  

2. **Key Question:**
   - How many relationships exist? Three? Four? Infinitely many?
   - Not fully answered here but explored through the idea of the **null space**.

### Non-Trivial Linear Combination  
- Linear combinations can be expressed algebraically and geometrically:  

    For example:  
    $a - b + c = 0$  
    This is a **non-trivial relationship** between vectors.

- Example of scalar multiplication: Multiply linear combinations by constants like $2$:  
    $$
    2a - 2b + 2c = 0
    $$

- Another relationship from scalar multiplication ($7$):  
    $$
    7a - 7c + 7d = 0
    $$

---

### Addition of Linear Combinations  
- Adding two linear combinations produces a **new linear combination**:  
    $$
    2a - b + d = 0
    $$  

- Geometric verification:  
   - Doubling $a$ and subtracting $b$, then adding $d$, results in reaching the origin.

### Linear Combinations as Vectors  
1. **Treating Linear Combinations as Vectors:**  
   - Non-trivial linear combinations that equal $0$ can be thought of as **vectors**.
   - Operations on these "vectors":
     - Addition
     - Scalar Multiplication

2. **Examples of Representations:**  
   - The linear combination $a - b + c = 0$ corresponds to the vector:  
     $$
     \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$  

   - Another example $a + d - c - b = 0$:  
     $$
     \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$

### Subspace and Span  
1. **Space of All Linear Combinations Yielding $0$:**
   - These linear combinations form a **vector space**:
     - Can multiply combinations by scalars ($\alpha, \beta$).
     - Add together to form new combinations.

   - Example:
     - Combine $\alpha (1, -1, 1, 0)$ and $\beta (1, -1, 0, 1)$.

2. **Null Space as a Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$:**
   - The null space is the **span** of these vectors:
     $$
     \text{Span}\left\{ 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 0
     \end{bmatrix}, 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \right\}
     $$
   - A span is always a **subspace**.

3. **Dimensionality:**
   - The null space is **2-dimensional**, as every linear combination can be expressed using constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

---

### Definition of the Null Space  
- The **null space** of a set of vectors is the subspace containing **all possible linear combinations** (including the trivial one, $\mathbf{0}$) that yield $0$.

- **In $\mathbb{R}^4$:**
   - The null space is the subspace associated with given vector combinations.  

---

### Importance of Null Space  
- Crucial for:
   - Solving **linear systems of equations**.
   - Analyzing **linear transformations**.  
   - Many other aspects of **linear algebra**.
