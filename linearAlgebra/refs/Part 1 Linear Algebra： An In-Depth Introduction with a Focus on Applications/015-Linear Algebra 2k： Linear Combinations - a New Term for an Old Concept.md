## Linear Combinations

### Definition
Linear combination is the name assigned to an operation that combines addition and multiplication of vectors by scalars. This applies to all types of vectors, not just those previously discussed.

### Formal Representation
Given two arbitrary vectors $a$ and $b$, we can create a linear combination as follows:
- Multiply each vector by a scalar (e.g., $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively).
- Add the scaled vectors.

The linear combination is expressed as:
$$
\alpha a + \beta b
$$

### Coefficients
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called the **coefficients** of the linear combination.
- These coefficients scale the vectors before combining them via addition.

### Operations on Vectors
There are only two basic operations that can be performed on vectors:
1. **Addition**:
    $$
    a + b
    $$
2. **Multiplication by Scalars**:
    $$
    \alpha a, \quad \beta b
    $$

By combining these, linear combinations allow us to describe how vectors can interact in a linear space.

### Practical Utility
- Linear combinations are widely used since addition and scalar multiplication are fundamental to vector algebra.
- Instead of separately discussing addition and scalar multiplication, the term "linear combinations" encapsulates both operations for convenience.

### Example
Consider two vectors in space. When they are added or scaled by any scalar, the result remains confined within the plane formed by these vectors. This is due to the nature of linear combinations. Mathematically, you cannot escape this plane using linear combinations.

#### Geometric Interpretation
- If two vectors lie in a plane, any linear combination of those vectors will also lie in the same plane. This is because the operation does not introduce any new dimensions.

### Terminology and Usage
- From this point forward, "linear combination" will be used frequently because it provides a condensed and efficient description of vector operations.
- It's worth noting that linear combinations form the foundation of linear algebra and will be referenced in nearly every topic moving forward.

### Humor and Advice
- The term "linear combinations" will appear very oftenâ€”don't turn it into a drinking game!
- Use alternative buzzwords like "fundamentally" or "of course" as substitutes.
- Stay responsible: only partake in activities like this if you're over 21 and avoid drugs. ðŸ˜„

### Summary
Linear combinations combine addition with scalar multiplication, forming the backbone of operations in vector spaces. Whether in geometry or algebra, they are integral to understanding vector interactions.
