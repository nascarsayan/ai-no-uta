## 1. Common Error in Decomposition Problems

### Misleading Argument Based on Divisibility

- Common misconception:
  - A decomposition problem does not have a solution if the last entry in the decomposition vectors is divisible by 3 while the last entry in the target vector is **not divisible by 3**.
- Why this is wrong:
  - Fractions are valid scalars for linear combinations. Hence, any decomposition vector can potentially eliminate problematic properties, e.g., divisibility constraints when scaled by $\frac{1}{3}$ or other fractions.

### Closure Properties in Linear Combinations

Core rules for linear combinations:
1. **Closed under addition**:
   - If you add two vectors satisfying a given property, the resulting vector will also satisfy that property.
2. **Closed under scalar multiplication**:
   - If you multiply a vector by a scalar, the resulting vector still satisfies the property (not limited to integers or fractionsâ€”must include all real numbers).

- For a decomposition to be impossible:
  - Property should fail **both under addition and scalar multiplication**.

### Correct Reasoning for Decomposition Validity

- True justification for invalid decomposition:
  - Decomposition vectors satisfy the property: "Middle entry = Average of other two entries."
  - Target vector does **not** satisfy this property (e.g., $4 \neq \frac{3+7}{2}$).
  
  Example:
  $$
  \text{Target vector:} \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \text{Decomposition vectors satisfy: } b_2 = \frac{b_1 + b_3}{2}.
  $$
  
- How a valid target vector would behave:
  - Replace $4$ (middle entry) in the target vector with $5$, since $5 = \frac{3+7}{2}$.
  - This removes the misalignment in the middle-entry property.

### Infinite Solutions for Correctly Aligned Decompositions

When the target vector satisfies the identified property:
- Decomposition problem **has solutions**, sometimes infinitely many solutions.
  
Example solution when target vector aligns with decomposition property:
$$
\text{Solution: } \begin{bmatrix} \frac{5}{3} \\ \frac{1}{3} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Confirming the correctness of the solution involves ensuring it satisfies:
- Addition properties.
- Scalar multiplication properties.

### Key Learning Takeaway:
- When analyzing decomposition problems:
  - Ensure properties are **closed** under both addition and scalar multiplication (including all real scalars, not just integers or fractions).
  - Incorrect arguments often overlook scalar multiplication with non-integer scalars.
