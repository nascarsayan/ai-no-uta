## Polynomial Interpolation: Lagrange Approach

### Introduction

- In this video, we discuss a different approach to polynomial interpolation that does not involve linear systems, matrices, or Gaussian elimination.
- This method is attributed to Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a renowned mathematician.
- Key insight:
  - The interpolating polynomial is **unique**.
  - The Lagrange approach leads to the same polynomial result as previous methods.

### The Core Idea

- Construct **special polynomials** called Lagrange basis polynomials.
- Each polynomial has these properties:
  1. **Value = 1** at one specific input point.
  2. **Value = 0** at all other input points.

#### Example:

Inputs: $1, 2, 3, 4$

1. $P_1(x)$ is **1 at $x = 1$** and **0 at $x = 2, 3, 4$.**
   - To create $P_1(x)$:
     $$
     P_1(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)}{(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)}
     $$
     - Denominator ensures that $P_1(1) = 1$.
     - Numerator forces $P_1(2), P_1(3)$, and $P_1(4)$ to be $0$.

2. Similarly, $P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$ are constructed:
   $$
   P_2(x) = \frac{(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)}{(2-1)(2-3)(2-4)}
   $$
   $$
   P_3(x) = \frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)}{(3-1)(3-2)(3-4)}
   $$
   $$
   P_4(x) = \frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}{(4-1)(4-2)(4-3)}
   $$

### Combining Basis Polynomials

- To interpolate values $f(1) = a$, $f(2) = b$, $f(3) = c$, $f(4) = d$, the final polynomial is:
  $$
  P(x) = aP_1(x) + bP_2(x) + cP_3(x) + dP_4(x)
  $$

- Proportions:
  - Coefficients ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$) come directly from the data points to be interpolated.

#### Key insight:
- The method ensures the polynomial passes through the given points by leveraging Lagrange basis polynomials.

### Example: Interpolating Data

Suppose the data points are:

| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   | 4      |
| 2   | 3      |
| 3   | 4      |
| 4   | 2      |

The interpolating polynomial is:
$$
P(x) = 4P_1(x) + 3P_2(x) + 4P_3(x) + 2P_4(x)
$$

Each term is scaled by the corresponding $y$-value and ensures accuracy of interpolation.

### Properties of Lagrange Basis Polynomials

- **Atomic Basis**: Each basis polynomial is not zero at one specific input and zero elsewhere.
- **Easy Construction**: Requires only straightforward algebraic calculations.
- **Efficiency**: Avoids solving linear systems, focusing entirely on basis properties.

### Comparison: Standard Basis vs. Lagrange Basis

#### Standard Basis:
- Basis terms: $1$, $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$
- Requires solving a **linear system** to find coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ for:
  $$
  P(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
  $$

#### Lagrange Basis:
- Basis terms: $P_1(x)$, $P_2(x)$, $P_3(x)$, $P_4(x)$
- Direct computation using given data points; no need to solve equations.

#### Why Lagrange is Better:
- For interpolation tasks with specific $x$ values, Lagrange basis simplifies calculations significantly.
- Each data point directly translates into a coefficient.

### Linear Algebra Perspective

- **Choosing a Basis** is central to linear algebra:
  - The **Standard Basis** ($1, x, x^2, x^3$) is optimal for decomposition problems.
  - The **Lagrange Basis** ($P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$) is optimal for interpolation problems.

#### Insight:
- The "best" basis depends entirely on the problem being solved.
- For interpolating data, the Lagrange basis is ideal because coefficients correspond directly to data points.

### Conclusion

- The Lagrange approach to polynomial interpolation highlights the importance of basis selection in linear algebra.
- Key benefits:
  - Makes interpolation intuitive and efficient.
  - Avoids matrix manipulations and linear systems.

By leveraging **Lagrange Basis Polynomials**, we gain a deeper understanding of interpolation and basis conceptsâ€”a core theme in linear algebra.
