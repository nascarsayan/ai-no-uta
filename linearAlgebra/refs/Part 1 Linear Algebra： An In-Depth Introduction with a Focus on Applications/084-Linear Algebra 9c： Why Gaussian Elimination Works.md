## Justification and Understanding of Gaussian Elimination via Row Operations

### 1. Purpose  
- The main goal is to **justify and understand Gaussian elimination** from the column point of view, which emphasizes the relationships between the columns of a matrix.

---

### 2. General Solution Insight  
- Given a linear system, insight allows us to determine the **general solution**:
  - The right-hand side vector equals a linear combination of the first two columns in a matrix.
  - **Key relationships:**
    - First column + Second column = Right-hand side  
    - Middle column = Average of the first and third columns.

**Example Observation:**

- For a matrix:

  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  s & 8 & n \\
  1 & 5 & 3 \\
  4 & 2 & 6
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  - The middle column is the average of the first and third columns:
    - $8 = \frac{s + n}{2}, \ 5 = \frac{1 + 3}{2}, \ 2 = \frac{4 + 6}{2}$.

  - **Key Result**: Row operations should preserve these relationships.

### 3. Row Operations and Relationships Among Columns

#### Row Operation 1: Adding a Multiple of One Row to Another  
- Consider adding $10 \times$ (1st row) to the 2nd row.

##### Transformation Steps:
1. First row remains unchanged.
2. New second row becomes:
   - $4 + 10 \cdot 1 = 14$  
   - $5 + 10 \cdot 2 = 25$  
   - $6 + 10 \cdot 3 = 36$
3. Apply the same operation to the right-hand side:
   - Original $9$ becomes $9 + 10 = 39$.

Updated Matrix:  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
14 & 25 & 36
\end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Result Observation:
- The **relationships among columns are preserved**:
  - Middle column remains the average of the first and third columns: 
    - $\frac{14 + 36}{2} = 25$.
  - Right-hand side remains the sum of the first two columns:
    - $39 = 14 + 25$.

---

#### Row Operation 2: Multiplying a Row by a Scalar  
- Multiply the third row by $11$.  

##### Transformation Steps:
1. The third row transforms to:
   - $7 \cdot 11 = 77$
   - $8 \cdot 11 = 88$
   - $9 \cdot 11 = 99$

Updated Third Row:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
77 & 88 & 99
\end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Result Observation:
- The **relationships remain unchanged**:
  - Middle column is still the average of the first and third columns.
  - Right-hand side is still the sum of the first two columns.

---

#### Row Operation 3: Swapping Two Rows  
- Swap the first and second rows.

##### Transformation Steps:
- The new row order becomes:
  - Second row copied to the first position.
  - First row moved to the second position.
  
Updated Matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
14 & 25 & 36 \\
1 & 2 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Result Observation:
- **All relationships are preserved**:
  - Relationships among columns (middle column = average of the other two) are still valid.
  - Right-hand side relationships remain unchanged.

---

### 4. Summary

#### Key Properties of Row Operations:
1. **Adding a multiple of one row to another**:
   - Preserves relationships among columns and between the right-hand side vector and the matrix columns.
   - Leaves the solution set unchanged.

2. **Multiplying a row by a scalar**:
   - Similarly preserves all relationships and keeps the same solution set.

3. **Swapping two rows**:
   - Does not change the relationships among columns or the solution set.

---

### 5. Gaussian Elimination Strategy
- Gaussian elimination systematically applies these row operations to simplify the matrix:
  - Transform the system into a simpler form (**row echelon form**) where relationships in the matrix columns become evident.
  - Maintains the **null space** and **particular solution** throughout.

#### Justification:
- These row operations do not alter the relationships among the matrix columns, ensuring that the transformed system is equivalent to the original system.

### 6. Key Question to Ponder:
- **Does Gaussian elimination preserve the column space?**
  - Explore how the row operations affect the span of the matrix columns.
