## Example: Decomposing a Vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$

### Task:
Decompose a vector as linear combinations of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ in all possible ways, and capture them as a single mathematical expression.

---

### Linear Dependence and Decomposition:
- The vectors $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are linearly dependent, as $d$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Specifically:

$$
d = 20a + 15b - 24c
$$

This relationship proves linear dependence, as it provides a **non-trivial linear combination** of the vectors that results in zero:

$$
20a + 15b - 24c - d = 0
$$

---

### Decomposing the Vector:
To find all possible decompositions, we:

1. Start with a **specific linear combination**:
   $$
   13a + 2b + 58c
   $$

2. Add an **arbitrary proportion** $\alpha$ of the **non-trivial linear combination** that produces zero:
   $$
   \alpha(20a + 15b - 24c - d)
   $$

---

### Final Expression:
The general linear combination of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that produces the vector is:

$$
13a + 2b + 58c + \alpha(20a + 15b - 24c - d)
$$

Expanding this, it becomes:

$$
(13 + 20\alpha)a + (2 + 15\alpha)b + (58 - 24\alpha)c - \alpha d
$$

---

### Interpretation:
- **Key Result**: All possible linear combinations that produce the decomposition can be written as above, where $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ is any scalar.
- The linear dependence among $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ ensures there are infinitely many decompositions.

---

### Takeaway:
This exercise illustrates that, despite the vectors being "different" from geometric vectors, the foundational concepts of **linear dependence** and **linear combinations** in linear algebra hold true. Every possible decomposition depends crucially on identifying the dependencies among the given vectors.
