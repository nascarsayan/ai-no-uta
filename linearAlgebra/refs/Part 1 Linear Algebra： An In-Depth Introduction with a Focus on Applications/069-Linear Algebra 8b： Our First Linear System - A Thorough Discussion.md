## Solving Linear Systems and Vector Decomposition

### Introduction to Linear Systems
- Linear systems group important information efficiently and organize unknowns into columns.
- Decomposition problems can be neatly expressed through matrix multiplication.
- Writing solutions in column format helps maintain consistency for unknowns (e.g., $x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$).

### Efficient Representation of Solutions
#### Example System:
Columns:

$$
\text{Column vectors representing the linear system.}
$$

Right-hand side:

$$
\text{Decomposition expressed as a linear combination of column vectors.}
$$

---

### Particular Solution and Null Space
#### Particular Solution:
- Values: $x = 8$, $y = 11$, $z = 0$, $t = 0$.
- Representation:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
11 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Concept: A particular solution is one specific solution to the system.

### Linear Dependence and General Solution
#### Linear Dependence Among Columns:
- Columns are linearly dependent if there are more vectors than dimensions.
- Example:
  - 4 vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ â†’ necessarily linearly dependent.

#### General Solution:
- Expresses all possible solutions:
  
$$
\text{General Solution} = \text{Particular Solution} + \text{Null Space}
$$

#### Null Space of Vertical Component:

$$
\alpha \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} +
\beta \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 11 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

General Solution representation:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
11 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\alpha 
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
5 \\
-1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\beta 
\begin{bmatrix}
7 \\
11 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Equivalence and Arbitrary Representations
#### Equivalence of Solutions:
- Systems can have multiple expressions representing the same set of solutions.
- Example:
  - One solution uses $8, 11, 0, 0$.
  - Another can use $1, 0, 0, 1$ with corresponding null space combinations.

#### Arbitrary Choice:
- Arbitrary selection of particular solutions and basis vectors is valid as long as:
  - Null space basis spans the same space.

### Geometric Analogy
#### Single Vector: The Straight Line
- Representation: $P + \alpha A$.

#### Two Vectors: The Plane
- Representation: $P + \alpha A + \beta B$.
- Describes a shifted plane.

### Comparison to High School Methods
- Reconciling high school methods with advanced practices reveals deeper geometric and algebraic insight.

### Summary
1. **General Solution**: Combination of a particular solution and null space.
2. **Arbitrary Representations**: Solutions can have multiple representations.
3. **Geometric Analogy**: Solutions can be interpreted in terms of lines and planes.
4. **Linear Dependence**: Provides flexibility in choosing basis vectors for null space representation.
