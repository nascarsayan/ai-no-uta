# Notes on Linear Dependence and Decomposition

## 1. Concept of Linear Dependence and its Effect on Decomposition

### Decomposing a Vector
- Objective: Decompose vector $D$ as a linear combination of $A$, $B$, and $C$.
- Key Step: Determine if vectors $A$, $B$, and $C$ are linearly dependent because this affects decomposition.

### Linear Dependence Example: $A$, $B$, and $C$
- In this case, vectors $A$, $B$, and $C$ are **linearly dependent**.
- Reason:
  - $B$ is twice $A$, i.e., $B = 2A$.
- Implication:
  - Infinite ways to decompose $D$.

### Non-Trivial Linear Combination
- Convert linear dependence into non-trivial linear combination:
  $$2A - B = 0$$
- This "fancy zero" can be added to any decomposition without altering the value.

### Example Decomposition of $D$
- Arrange $D$ as:
  $$D = C - B$$
- Infinite equivalent decompositions are possible by adding multiples of the "fancy zero".

### Full Linear Combination Form
- General decomposition:
  $$D = 2\alpha A + (\alpha - 1)B + C$$
- This captures all possible ways to express $D$ as a combination of $A$, $B$, and $C$.

## 2. Dependent Set with Zero Vector

### Another Example: $A$, $B$, and $C$ (with $C$ as the zero vector)
- **Are they linearly dependent?**
  - Yes, because the zero vector ($C$) can be expressed as a trivial combination:
    $$C = 0A + 0B + 1C$$
- The presence of the zero vector implies linear dependence.

### Non-Trivial Linear Combination
- One simple way to represent linear dependence:
  $$C = 0$$

### Decomposition of $D$
- Particular decomposition:
  $$D = 2A + \alpha C$$
- Infinite decompositions by adding multiples of the "fancy zero" ($C$).

## Key Insights
1. **Linear Dependence and Zero Vector**:
   - Presence of a zero vector guarantees dependence.
2. **Flexibility in Decomposition**:
   - Non-trivial linear combinations provide multiple equivalent decompositions.
3. **Geometric Intuition**:
   - Zero vector does not alter the geometric properties of the decomposition.

These exercises reinforce the concept of linear dependence and its influence on vector decomposition. The "fancy zero" plays a crucial role in enabling infinite equivalent forms for decomposition!
