## Linear Dependence of Polynomials

### Problem Statement
Consider four polynomials on the board. The question is:
- Can one of these polynomials be expressed as a linear combination of the others?
- Are these polynomials linearly dependent?

---

### Conceptual Background
Previously, you might have been unsure about this. However, with an understanding of linear algebra:
- The answer is **Yes**, the polynomials are linearly dependent. Therefore, one of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.

### Key Reasoning

#### 1. Polynomials as Vectors
Each polynomial is treated as a vector in the vector space of quadratic polynomials:
- Quadratic polynomials belong to the space of polynomials of degree **up to 2**.
- This space is **three-dimensional**.

#### 2. Basis for the Vector Space
The space of quadratic polynomials has a basis:
- A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the vector space.
- For this space, a basis is:
  $$
  \{x^2, x, 1\}
  $$

#### 3. Verifying the Basis
To confirm this is a basis:
- **Linear Independence**:
  - $x^2$ cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $x$ and $1$, since there are no terms that produce $x^2$.
  - Similarly, $x$ and $1$ are not linear combinations of each other or $x^2$.
- **Spanning**:
  - Any quadratic polynomial (e.g., $ax^2 + bx + c$) can be written as a linear combination of $x^2$, $x$, and $1$.

Thus, the set $\{x^2, x, 1\}$ is linearly independent and spans the space of quadratic polynomials. Therefore, it serves as a basis.

#### 4. Dimensions Argument
Given that:
- The vector space is **three-dimensional**, and
- There are **four polynomials**, 

By the **Principle of Linear Dependence**:
- Any set of four or more vectors in a three-dimensional space is linearly dependent.

As a result, the four polynomials are necessarily linearly dependent.

### Example of Linear Combination
To demonstrate, any other quadratic polynomial can be expressed as a linear combination of $\{x^2, x, 1\}$:
- For instance:
  $$
  p(x) = a \cdot x^2 + b \cdot x + c \cdot 1
  $$
  where $a, b, c$ are coefficients.

While finding the exact coefficients may require effort, we can assert the decomposition **exists** without explicitly calculating it.

### Conclusion

- **Key Insight**: When you have more vectors than the dimensions of the space, they must be linearly dependent.
- Thus, the set of four polynomials is linearly dependent, and at least one of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.

### Broader Perspective
This example highlights the power of linear algebra:
- It simplifies seemingly complex problems, like determining dependence in a set of polynomials.
- These principles of linear algebra will continue to provide deeper insights into more problems, as shown in future applications.
