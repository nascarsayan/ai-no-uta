## Polynomial Interpolation and Alternative Functions

### 1. Problems with Polynomial Interpolation
- While polynomial interpolation can pass through the prescribed data points, it suffers from:
  - **Unwanted artifacts**:
    - Behavior outside the data range that has no relation to the actual data.
  - **Unwanted wiggles**:
    - Oscillations not characteristic of the underlying data.
  - This issue is known as the **Runge phenomenon**.

### 2. Alternative Approach: Replacing Polynomials
- Instead of using high-degree polynomial functions, consider alternative functions that are more suitable for the given data:
  - Example: Replace $x^3$ with $1/x$.
    - $1/x$ is relatively flat, aligning better with flat data.
    - $x^3$ is not flat and misrepresents trends outside the data range.
- With this substitution:
  - The problem remains **linear**, as the coefficients enter linearly into the equations.
  - Only the **specific values** in the system will change.

### 3. Updating the System with $1/x$
- Substitution of $1/x$ into the system involves modifying the last column of the matrix:
  - Original values (using $x^3$): $8, 27, 64$.
  - New values (using $1/x$): $1/2, 1/3, 1/4$.

#### System Update:
For $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$:
- The columns are updated as:
  - At $x = 1$: $1/1 = 1$.
  - At $x = 2$: $1/2 = 0.5$.
  - At $x = 3$: $1/3 \approx 0.333$.
  - At $x = 4$: $1/4 = 0.25$.

Thus, updated entries:
$$
\text{Last column of the matrix: } \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1/2 \\ 1/3 \\ 1/4 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### 4. New Interpolating Function and Results
1. Solve the updated system $Ax = b$ with the modified matrix values.
2. Plot the resulting function; the updated interpolant appears as a **green curve**.

#### Observations:
- The **wiggles** in the curve have been dramatically reduced or almost entirely eliminated.
- The new function provides **better extrapolation**:
  - Between $x = 4$ and $x = 5$, the new interpolant continues **much more flatly**, aligning better with the data than the original function.

#### Key Observation:
- The choice of **suitable interpolation functions (e.g., $1/x$ over $x^3$)** results in:
  - Improved data fitting.
  - Smoother transitions and behavior that adheres to data characteristics.

### 5. Takeaways for Interpolation
- **Function choice matters**:
  - Functions that resemble the behavior of the data lead to better interpolation results.
- **Experience is crucial**:
  - Selecting suitable functions comes with experience and understanding of the data.
- **Fundamental principle**:
  - Regardless of the functions chosen, interpolation boils down to solving the system of equations:
    $$
    Ax = b
    $$
