## Introduction to Geometric Vectors

- **Definition**: Geometric vectors are directed segments.
- **Purpose of Video**: Explain how geometric vectors align with the concepts of linear algebra.
    - Geometric vectors can be added.
    - They can be multiplied by numbers (scalars).

## 1. Directed Segments as Vectors

- Directed segments are vectors in the sense of linear algebra:
    - **Addition**: Combine multiple vectors.
    - **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply a vector by a constant.

### A Thought Before Starting:
- Avoid visualizing a coordinate grid when discussing geometric vectors.
- Geometric vectors:
    - Can be introduced in two ways:
        1. As directed segments.
        2. As (ordered) coordinate pairs.
    - **For now**: Focus on directed segments as pure geometric objects.

## 2. Relating Locations via Geometric Vectors

### Example: Traveling Between Villages
- Imagine starting at "Village O" and going to "Village R".
    - Simply stating the distance (e.g., "10 miles") narrows it down to a circle.
    - Adding direction narrows it down further.
    - **Combination of both** forms a geometric vector.

### Visualization:
- A geometric vector can be thought of as an arrow:
    - Denotes both **distance** and **direction**.
    - Example: From point O (origin) to point R.

## 3. Addition of Geometric Vectors

- **Tip-to-Tail Rule**:
    - Add two vectors (example: "Village O to R" + "Village R to T").
    - Resulting vector (called $c$):
        - Connects the origin directly to the final point.
        - Represents the net displacement.

### Formula:
$$
\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}
$$
- Where $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are the initial vectors.

## 4. Scalar Multiplication of Geometric Vectors

### Definition:
- Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its length but preserves its direction.

### Examples:
- For a vector $\mathbf{v}$:
    - $2\mathbf{v}$: Same direction, double the length.
    - $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{v}$: Same direction, half the length.
    - $-1\mathbf{v}$: Opposite direction, same length as $\mathbf{v}$.
    - $-2\mathbf{v}$: Opposite direction, double the length.

### Utility:
- Scalar multiplication scales the vector without altering its geometric representation beyond direction and magnitude.

## 5. Vectors Along a Single Line

- Consider vectors constrained to a straight line:
    - Addition and scalar multiplication work as expected.
    - The resulting vectors remain on that line.

### Visualization:
- Even when constrained to one dimension:
    - Vectors can represent motion purely along a line.
    - Operations (addition, scalar scaling) are still valid.

## 6. Vectors in Three Dimensions

- **Conceptual Extension**:
    - Move beyond a 2D plane to full three-dimensional space.
    - Visualize:
        - Points in 3D space (e.g., planets in a solar system or objects in a room).
        - Displacement between points as vectors.

- **Example**:
    - A fly moves from one point to another in 3D space.
    - The total net displacement is captured by a vector.

---

## 7. Planar Consistency in 3D

- When adding two vectors in 3D space:
    - The result (sum) lies in the plane defined by the initial two vectors.
    - This illustrates the geometric self-consistency of vector addition in higher dimensions.

---

## 8. Key Observations:

1. **Geometric Vectors as Linear Algebra Objects**:
    - Addition and scalar multiplication justify their treatment as vectors.

2. **Applicability in Different Contexts**:
    - 2D plane, a single line, or 3D space.
    - Operations remain consistent.

3. **Visualization of Vectors**:
    - Vital to understand geometric configurations and maintain clarity in higher dimensions.

### Closing Note:
- Vectors provide the foundation for combining geometry and algebra in linear algebra.
- Treat geometric vectors as pure geometric objects for better conceptual clarity moving forward.
