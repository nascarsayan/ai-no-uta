## Gaussian Elimination: Order of Operations in Matrix Inversion

### Key Points to Note:
1. **Order Flexibility in Gaussian Elimination**:
   - When inverting a matrix using the row reduced echelon form algorithm, the *order of operations does not matter* as long as:
     - The **left half** contains the identity matrix by the end.
     - The **right half** contains the inverse of the matrix.

2. **Benefits of Flexible Operations**:
   - Particularly useful when computations are done by hand.
   - Enables avoiding fractions during intermediary steps for better computational efficiency.

### Algorithm Example:

Given a matrix, start with row operations:

#### Step 1: First Pivot Selection
- Choose a convenient pivot entry.
  - Example: If the first row, first column entry is already 1, use it as the pivot.

#### Step 2: Elimination Above and Below the Pivot
- Eliminate entries *above* and *below* the pivot creatively, in any order.

#### Step 3: Repeat for Remaining Pivots
- Choose the next pivot creatively and proceed with elimination above and below.

---

### Gaussian Elimination Example:

Consider a matrix \( A \). The creative approach discussed avoids fractions with strategic row operations.

#### Initial Matrix Structure:
Letâ€™s assume:
\[
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 3 \\
0 & 4 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

**Operation Steps**:

1. **Using Creative Pivot Orders**:
   - Select the **first pivot** strategically:
     \[
     \text{Pivot}: A_{1,1} = 2
     \]
   - Perform an operation (e.g., dividing a row or swapping rows) to simplify the pivot:
     \[
     R_1 \to \frac{1}{2} R_1
     \]

2. **Avoid Fractions, Elimination Options**:
   - Add or subtract rows to eliminate entries below and above pivots without creating fractions.

---

### Example Operations to Avoid Fractions:

1. **Row Operations on Matrix \( A \):**
   - Subtract row 3 from row 2:
     \[
     R_2 \to R_2 - R_3
     \]
   - Resulting intermediate structure:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     2 & -1 & 0 \\
     1 & -4 & 5 \\
     0 & 4 & -2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

2. **Next Pivot Selection**:
   - Use \( A_{2,2} = -4 \) creatively for further operations, ensuring simplicity.

---

### Final Structure:

Achieve the identity matrix on the left-hand side:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
The right-hand side contains the **inverse of \( A \)**.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Be Creative with the Order**:
   - The order of Gaussian elimination does not matter for finding an inverse. Use operations that simplify the process.

2. **Avoid Fractions**:
   - Prioritize pivot elements and row operations that lead to cleaner intermediate steps.

3. **Applicability**:
   - This flexibility *cannot be exploited* when simply performing row reduction to compute the reduced echelon form. For that, the **standard pivot column order** is mandatory.

4. **Canonical Form**:
   - Proper reduced echelon form requires that pivot columns appear as early as possible. Deviation from this order may result in a different equivalent matrix.

5. **Conclusion on Inversion**:
   - When inverting matrices:
     - Identify pivot columns in advance.
     - Exploit flexible operations strategically to streamline the process and avoid cumbersome calculations.
