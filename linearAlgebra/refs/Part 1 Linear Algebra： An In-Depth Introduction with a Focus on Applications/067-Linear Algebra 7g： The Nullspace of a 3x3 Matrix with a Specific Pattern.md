## Null Space of $3 \times 3$ Matrices

### Matrix Pattern
- The focus is on $3 \times 3$ matrices with a specific pattern:
  - **First Column**: Contains one nonzero entry followed by two zeros. 
  - This pattern frequently appears in linear algebra for underlying theoretical reasons.

### Strategy for Finding Null Space

1. **Step-by-Step Approach**:
   - Begin with a specific matrix example and determine its null space.
   - Move from a concrete numerical example to understanding the general structure of the problem.
   - Apply this big-picture understanding to more complex examples.

2. **Initial Observations**:
   - **First Column**: The zeros in the second and third rows of the first column mean it does not contribute to nullifying entries two and three.
   - All responsibility falls onto **Columns 2 and 3**.

3. **Proportionality Between Columns**:
   - Columns 2 and 3 often have proportional sub-columns. For instance, if the sub-columns are in the ratio $3:1$, appropriate coefficients (e.g., $3$ and $-1$) can nullify entries two and three.

    $$
    3 \times \text{Column 2} - 1 \times \text{Column 3} 
    $$

4. **Using the First Column**:
   - After nullifying entries two and three, use the first column to ensure the first entry is zero. Combine coefficients appropriately to achieve this.

### Detailed Example: Matrix Null Space

#### Example 1
- Use a matrix with columns having sub-column proportions $3:1$.

Calculate contributions:

- Entries two and three are nullified using $3 \times \text{Column 2} - 1 \times \text{Column 3}$.

- **First Entry Fix**:
  Combine contributions from Columns 2 and 3 with the necessary proportion of Column 1 to nullify the first entry.

#### Null Space Vector:
For example, the null space might be determined to be:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Example 2: Increased Complexity
- Consider a matrix where sub-columns of Columns 2 and 3 are in the proportion $7:2$.

Calculate contributions:

- Handle entries two and three:

    $$
    7 \times \text{Column 2} - 2 \times \text{Column 3}
    $$

- **First Entry Fix**:
  Nullify contributions from Columns 2 and 3 by taking the required proportion of Column 1 (e.g., $11/12$).

#### Null Space Vector:
Express final result using integers instead of fractions:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} -118 \\ 84 \\ 24 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### General Principles
1. **Linear Dependence and Submatrix Reduction**:
   - Often, the $3 \times 3$ matrix problem reduces to analyzing a $2 \times 2$ submatrix.
   - Linearly dependent sub-columns in the $2 \times 2$ submatrix correspond to linear dependence in the original matrix.

2. **Alternative Patterns**:
   - Other configurations, such as having the nonzero entry surrounded by zeros in different positions, follow the same logic.

3. **Big Picture**:
   - Techniques like Gaussian Elimination will transform generic matrices into patterns similar to the one analyzed here, making this approach broadly applicable.

### Concluding Remarks
- Recognizing these patterns in matrices is a key skill that accelerates problem-solving in linear algebra.
- This method lays the foundation for advanced techniques like Gaussian elimination.
