## Linear Combinations with Coefficients Adding to 1

### Problem Setup
- Consider two vectors, **$\mathbf{A}$** and **$\mathbf{B}$**.
- We are tasked with analyzing all possible linear combinations of these vectors in the form:
  $$
  \alpha \mathbf{A} + \beta \mathbf{B}
  $$
  where the coefficients satisfy the constraint:
  $$
  \alpha + \beta = 1
  $$

### Objectives of the Question
- Understand the connection between **linear combinations** and **geometry**.
- Visualize how algebraic constraints translate into geometric shapes.

### Solution Analysis
#### Case 1: Specific Coefficients
1. **$\alpha = 1$, $\beta = 0$**
   - Substituting:
     $$
     \alpha \mathbf{A} + \beta \mathbf{B} = 1 \cdot \mathbf{A} + 0 \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A}
     $$
   - The tip of the resulting vector is exactly at **$\mathbf{A}$**.

2. **$\alpha = 0$, $\beta = 1$**
   - Substituting:
     $$
     \alpha \mathbf{A} + \beta \mathbf{B} = 0 \cdot \mathbf{A} + 1 \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}
     $$
   - The tip of the resulting vector is exactly at **$\mathbf{B}$**.

#### Case 2: Intermediate Coefficients
3. **$\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 0.5$**
   - Substituting:
     $$
     \alpha \mathbf{A} + \beta \mathbf{B} = 0.5 \cdot \mathbf{A} + 0.5 \cdot \mathbf{B}
     $$
   - Rewriting this as:
     $$
     \frac{\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}}{2}
     $$
   - Geometrically, this point lies **halfway between $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$** â€“ at the **midpoint**.

#### Case 3: General Linear Combinations
- When $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary values satisfying $\alpha + \beta = 1$, the resulting vector lies **on the straight line** passing through the tips of **$\mathbf{A}$** and **$\mathbf{B}$**.
- To verify this, consider more examples:
   1. $\alpha = 2$, $\beta = -1$:
      $$
      2\mathbf{A} + (-1)\mathbf{B} = 2\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}
      $$
   2. $\alpha = -1$, $\beta = 2$:
      $$
      (-1)\mathbf{A} + 2\mathbf{B} = -\mathbf{A} + 2\mathbf{B}
      $$

- In both cases, the vector moves **along the infinite line through $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$**, extending in both directions.

### Geometric Insights
- **Key Property**: The constraint $\alpha + \beta = 1$ ensures that all **linear combinations** lie on a **line segment** if $\alpha, \beta \in [0, 1]$ and on an **infinite line** otherwise.

#### Alternate Representation:
- Solve the constraint $\beta = 1 - \alpha$ and substitute into the general form:
  $$
  \alpha \mathbf{A} + (1 - \alpha) \mathbf{B} = \alpha (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) + \mathbf{B}
  $$
- Interpretation:
  - Start at $\mathbf{B}$ (when $\alpha = 0$).
  - As $\alpha$ varies, slide **along the vector $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}$**, stretching the line infinitely in both directions.

#### Geometric Advantage:
- This formulation clearly shows that the line passes through:
  1. **$\mathbf{A}$**, when $\alpha = 1$.
  2. **$\mathbf{B}$**, when $\alpha = 0$.
  3. Extends to any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.

### Algebraic vs Geometric Perspective
1. Algebraically:
   - The solved constraint simplifies computations: $\alpha$ becomes the single degree of freedom.
   - $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ allows unbounded combinations without worrying about maintaining the constraint.

2. Geometrically:
   - The rewritten form clarifies **why the result is a straight line**:
     - $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}$ is the direction vector.
     - $\mathbf{B}$ is the starting point for the sliding motion along the line.

---

### Conclusion
- The shape defined by all linear combinations of **$\alpha \mathbf{A} + \beta \mathbf{B}$**, where $\alpha + \beta = 1$, is a **straight line**.
- The line passes through:
  - The points **$\mathbf{A}$** and **$\mathbf{B}$**.
  - Extends infinitely in both directions for unbounded $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
