## 1. Subspaces and Closure Properties

### Subspaces:
- Definition:
  - A subspace satisfies three key properties: 
    1. Closure under addition.
    2. Closure under scalar multiplication.
    3. Linear property.

- Recap:
  - These three properties—closure under addition, multiplication, and linearity—all effectively mean the same thing in the context of subspaces.

## 2. Linear Algebra Relevance

### Key Point:
- The concept of subspaces is crucial for much of linear algebra.
- Important note to keep in mind when studying linear equations.

---

## 3. Example - Vector Relationships

### Example:
- $b$ is expressed as a sum of vectors $a$ and $c$:
  $$
  b = a + c
  $$

---

## 4. Coefficients and Vector Constraints

### Unknown Coefficients:
- Constructing equations using unknown coefficients $x$ and $y$:
  - These coefficients represent the structure of linear combinations.
  
### Vector Bootstrapping:
- Emphasis on bootstrapping formats to identify relationships between vectors and coefficients.

---

## 5. Example - Vector Equation 

### Equation Manipulation:
- Rearrange vector relationships:
  $$
  c = a + b \implies a + b - c = z
  $$
