## Symmetric Matrices

### Definition
- Symmetric matrices are **square matrices** that are **equal to their own transpose**.
  - If $A$ is a symmetric matrix, then $A = A^T$.
  
### Descriptions of Symmetry:

1. **Row-Column Equality**:
   - A matrix is symmetric when its rows are the same as its columns.
     Example:
     - Row 3 = [3, 5, 6]
     - Column 3 = [3, 5, 6]
   - This relationship holds for all rows and columns in a symmetric matrix.

2. **Reflection about the Main Diagonal**:
   - If you flip the matrix across its main diagonal, it remains unchanged.
   - This reflection symmetry characterizes symmetric matrices.

3. **Equal Corresponding Entries**:
   - The corresponding entries across the diagonal are equal:
     $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all $i$ and $j$.

### Visual and Functional Appeal
- The structural symmetry makes these matrices visually appealing and computationally interesting.
