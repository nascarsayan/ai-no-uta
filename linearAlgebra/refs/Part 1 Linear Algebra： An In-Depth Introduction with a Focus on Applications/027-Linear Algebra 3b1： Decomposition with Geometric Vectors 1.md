## 1. Linear Decomposition of Vectors

### Introduction
- The goal is to solve decomposition problems starting with **geometric vectors**, followed by **polynomials** and **$\mathbb{R}^n$**.
- Despite the difference in these objects, the concept of decomposition applies uniformly.
- **Linear combinations** work similarly across these objects, linking decomposition concepts.

---

## 2. First Example: Decomposing $\mathbf{C}$ in terms of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

- Task: Express vector $\mathbf{C}$ using linear combinations of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.
- Observation: 
  - $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are at a 90째 angle, simplifying the problem.

#### Solution:
- Decompose $\mathbf{C}$:
  $$
  \mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{A} + 1 \mathbf{B}
  $$
- This result is obtained using trial and error and familiarity with linear combinations.

## 3. Comparison to the Dollar Bills and Quarters Problem

- **Dollar-Quarters Problem Setup**:
  - Suppose you have exactly $100 in some combination of dollar bills and quarters.
  - The system lacks a unique solution due to degrees of freedom in coefficients.

- **Key Difference**:
  - Vector decomposition in geometry or $\mathbb{R}^n$ often has unique solutions due to richer vector spaces.
  - Richer objects (e.g., vectors or polynomials) make unique decomposition feasible.

#### Summary:
- Unique decomposition depends on the richness of the objects:
  - $\mathbb{R}^n$ > Polynomials > Single Numbers.
  - Example: Human perception of **audio signals** lets the brain decompose them into individual components effortlessly because audio signals are rich in information.

## 4. Additional Examples of Decomposition

### Example 2: Decomposing $\mathbf{D}$ in terms of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$
- Task: Express $\mathbf{D}$ using $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.
- Observation: $\mathbf{D}$ can be obtained by flipping ($-\mathbf{A}$) and then using $\mathbf{B}$.

#### Solution:
- Decompose $\mathbf{D}$:
  $$
  \mathbf{D} = -1 \mathbf{A} + 1 \mathbf{B}
  $$
- Casual notation: $\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{A}$.

---

### Example 3: Decomposing $\mathbf{E}$ in terms of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$
- Observation: $\mathbf{E}$ is the **opposite** of $\mathbf{A}$.

#### Solution:
- Decompose $\mathbf{E}$:
  $$
  \mathbf{E} = -1 \mathbf{A} + 0 \mathbf{B}
  $$
- Casual notation: $\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{A}$.

---

### Example 4: Decomposing $\mathbf{F}$ in terms of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$
- Observation: $\mathbf{F}$ is the **opposite** of $\mathbf{C}$. Using the result for $\mathbf{C}$ simplifies the calculation.

#### Solution:
- Recall $\mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{A} + 1 \mathbf{B}$.
- Decompose $\mathbf{F}$:
  $$
  \mathbf{F} = -\Big(\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{A} + 1 \mathbf{B}\Big)
  $$
  Simplifying:
  $$
  \mathbf{F} = -\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{A} - 1 \mathbf{B}
  $$

## 5. Insights on Orientation and Unique Solutions

### Orthogonality and Orientation
- Having a 90째 angle (orthogonality) between $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ simplifies decomposition.
- Rotating the system does not complicate the decomposition; the 90째 angle is what matters.

### Uniqueness of Solutions
- Question: Are these decompositions **unique**?
  - For a given vector, is there only one set of coefficients (scalars) for $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ that achieves the decomposition?
  - This is an important concept to reflect on.

---

## 6. Next Steps
- Future study will involve more complicated examples where $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are **not** orthogonal.
- Exploration will cover how the lack of a 90째 angle impacts the decomposition process.
