# Analysis of Linear Subspaces from the Transcript

## Subspaces of Vector Sets

The question aims to determine which of the given sets constitute linear subspaces using two fundamental tests:
1. **Closed under Addition:** Adding any two vectors from the set results in a vector within the same set.
2. **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying any vector in the set by a scalar results in a vector within the same set.

### Case A: Set of all vectors on a straight line passing through the origin

- **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:** Yes. Multiplying any vector by a scalar keeps it on the same straight line.
- **Closed under Addition:** Yes. The sum of any two vectors lying on the straight line also lies on the same line.

Conclusion:
- A straight line passing through the origin **is a linear subspace**.

---

### Case B: Set of all vectors on a straight line not passing through the origin

- **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:** No. Multiplying a vector from this line by a scalar results in vectors that no longer lie on the same line, as the line is not through the origin.
- **Zero Vector:** Absent. A valid subspace must contain the zero vector, which is missing here.

Conclusion:
- A straight line not passing through the origin **is not a linear subspace**.

### Case C: Set of all vectors between two rays starting at the origin

- **Closed under Addition:** Yes. The sum of two vectors stays within the angle formed by the rays, as demonstrated by the parallelogram rule.
- **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:**
  - For positive scalars: Yes—results stay within the set.
  - For zero: Yes—the zero vector is part of the set.
  - For negative scalars: No—multiplication by a negative scalar results in opposite-direction vectors that fall outside the angle.

Conclusion:
- This set **is not a linear subspace** due to failure under scalar multiplication with negative values.

---

### Case D: Set of all vectors between two straight lines passing through the origin

- **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:** Yes. Multiplying by any positive, negative, or zero scalar keeps vectors within the set.
- **Closed under Addition:** No. The sum of vectors from different parts of this angle may result in vectors outside the angle.

Conclusion:
- This set **is not a linear subspace** because it is not closed under addition.

---

### Case E: Set containing only the zero vector

- **Closed under Addition:** Yes. Adding the zero vector to itself still yields the zero vector.
- **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:** Yes. Multiplying the zero vector by any scalar results in the zero vector.

Conclusion:
- The set containing only the zero vector **is a linear subspace**.

|---------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A. Straight line passing through the origin | Yes       | Closed under addition and scalar multiplication.                    |
| B. Straight line not passing through origin | No        | Fails scalar multiplication and lacks the zero vector.              |
| C. Vectors between two rays (origin-based)  | No        | Fails scalar multiplication with negative scalars.                  |
| D. Vectors between two lines (origin-based) | No        | Fails closure under vector addition.                                |
| E. Zero vector only                         | Yes       | Closed under addition and scalar multiplication.                    |

## Insights About Subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$

- In a **two-dimensional plane**, proper subspaces are constrained:
  - **Zero-Dimensional Subspace:** The set containing only the zero vector.
  - **One-Dimensional Subspaces:** Straight lines passing through the origin.
- A **two-dimensional subspace** is the plane itself.

## Extensions to $\mathbb{R}^3$

In $\mathbb{R}^3$, consider the following possible subspaces:
1. **Zero-Dimensional Subspace:** Contains only the zero vector.
2. **One-Dimensional Subspaces:** Lines passing through the origin in any direction.
3. **Two-Dimensional Subspaces:** Planes passing through the origin.
4. **Three-Dimensional Subspace:** The entire $\mathbb{R}^3$ space itself.
