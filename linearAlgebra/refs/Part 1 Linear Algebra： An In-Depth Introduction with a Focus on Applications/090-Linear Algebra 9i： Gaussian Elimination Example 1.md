## Understanding the Problem of Solving Linear Equations

### Overview of the System
1. The problem is to analyze a system of linear equations with **five columns**, each living in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
2. **Key attributes** of the system:
    - There are **two linearly independent columns** (e.g., the first two columns are linearly independent).
    - Columns are **linearly independent** if one is not a scalar multiple of the other.
    
    **Key observation**:  
    - First entries of the two columns are in proportion $2:1$.
    - Second entries are in proportion $7:3$, which does not equal $2:1$.  
    - Thus, the columns are **linearly independent**.

3. **Spanning $\mathbb{R}^2$**:  
    With two linearly independent columns in $\mathbb{R}^2$, they span the entire space $\mathbb{R}^2$.  
    **Guarantee**: The system is guaranteed to have a solution for any given right-hand side.

### Uniqueness of Solutions
1. Since there are **five columns in $\mathbb{R}^2$**, the columns are necessarily **linearly dependent** (as there are more vectors than the dimension of the space).
2. By the **Rank-Nullity Theorem**:
    $$
    \text{Dimension of Null Space} + \text{Dimension of Column Space} = \text{Number of Columns.}
    $$
    - Number of columns = $5$.  
    - Dimension of column space (spanning $\mathbb{R}^2$) = $2$.  
    - Therefore, the null space has dimension $3$.

3. **Key Insight**:  
    A null space of dimension $3$ implies a rich variety of solutions (no unique solution).

## Gaussian Elimination Procedure

### Step 1: Subtract 3 Row 1 from Row 2
1. Pivot on the first element (row 1, column 1):  
   Subtracting $3$ times Row 1 from Row 2 eliminates the entry in Row 2, column 1.
2. **Row operations**:
    - $7 \rightarrow 7 - 6 = 1$
    - $10 \rightarrow 10 - 9 = 1$
    - $13 \rightarrow 13 - 12 = 1$
    - $16 \rightarrow 16 - 15 = 1$
3. Changes also apply to the right-hand side:
    - $-6 - (-12) = -6 + 12 = 6$.

### Step 2: Subtract 2 Row 2 from Row 1
1. Pivot on the second element (row 2, column 2).  
   Subtracting $2$ times Row 2 from Row 1 eliminates the entry in Row 1, column 2.
2. **Row operations**:
    - $3 - 2 = 1$
    - $4 - 2 = 2$
    - $5 - 2 = 3$
3. Adjust the right-hand side:
    - $-4 - 2(-4) = -4 + 8 = 4$.

### Result of Gaussian Elimination
After performing the steps:
- The matrix is **row-reduced**, and the system is ready for **back-substitution** to determine solutions.

## Solutions of the Linear System

### Particular Solution
1. **Decompose the right-hand side** into the column space:
    - Use four of the first column and $-4$ of the second column.
2. Verification:
    - First entry: $4 - (-8) = -4$.
    - Second entry: $12 - 28 = -16$.  

Thus, the **particular solution works**.

### Null Space
1. **Dimension of null space**:  
    Null space is **3-dimensional**.  
    **Key elements** of the null space derive from columns that are combinations of others.

2. First element:  
    Subtract one of the first column and one of the second column to yield the zero vector.  
    Resulting vector:  
    $$
    [1, 1, -1, 0, 0]
    $$

3. Second element:  
    Subtract contributions from the corresponding columns to produce zero.  
    Resulting vector:  
    $$
    [2, 1, 0, -1, 0]
    $$

4. Third element:  
    Analyze the fifth column relative to the others to determine its contribution.  
    Resulting vector:  
    $$
    [3, 1, 0, 0, -1]
    $$

### General Solution
The general solution is given by the sum of the particular solution and the null space components.  
If $\mathbf{x}_p$ is the particular solution, and $\mathbf{N}_i$ are the null space elements:
$$
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_p + c_1 \mathbf{N}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{N}_2 + c_3 \mathbf{N}_3.
$$

## Verification
1. Verified that combinations of vectors from the null space and particular solution satisfy the original equation system.
2. **Future step**: When studying **matrix multiplication**, we can derive alternative proofs of correctness.

The system is now fully solved:
- Particular solution found.
- Null space elements identified.
- The general solution expressed.
