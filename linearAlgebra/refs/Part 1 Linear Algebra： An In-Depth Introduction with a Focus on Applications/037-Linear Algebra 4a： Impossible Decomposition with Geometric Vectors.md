## 1. Introduction to Decomposition Problems with No Solutions

- **Context**: 
  - Previously, we explored linear combinations and decomposition, the foundations of linear algebra.
  - Moving forward, we delve into decomposition problems, including cases with:
    - No solutions (current focus).
    - Infinitely many solutions (future chapters).

## 2. Decomposition Problems with No Solutions

- **Scenario**: 
  - Previously discussed problems had a unique solution, which appears ideal.
  - However, decomposition problems do not always guarantee solutions, and this complexity is what makes linear algebra rich and useful.

## 3. Geometric Example: No Solution due to Alignment

### Case 1: Two Vectors on the Same Line
- **Setup**:  
  - Given two vectors $A$ and $B$ lying on the same line.
  - Given a target vector $C$ not on the same line.
  - The task is to express $C$ as a linear combination of $A$ and $B$.

- **Observation**:  
  - All linear combinations of $A$ and $B$ lie on the same line.
  - Since $C$ does not lie on this line, the decomposition problem has no solution.

### Explanation
- **Reasoning**:  
  - If $A$ and $B$ point along the same line, all their linear combinations will also lie along that line.
  - $C$ does not point along the same line, meaning it cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $A$ and $B$.

$$
\text{If } C \notin \text{span}(A, B), \text{ then no decomposition exists.}
$$

### Case 2: Three Dimensions - Target Outside a Plane
- **Setup**:  
  - Two decomposition vectors lie in a plane.
  - The target vector does not lie in this plane.

- **Explanation**:  
  - All linear combinations of the plane's vectors remain in the same plane.  
  - If the target vector lies outside the plane, it cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the plane's vectors.

$$
\text{If the target vector is outside the subspace spanned by the decomposition vectors, } \text{no solution exists.}
$$

## 4. Generalizing to Other Vector Spaces

- **Transition from Geometry to Algebra**:
  - Terms like "line" and "plane" are geometric, but the concepts apply to vector spaces.
  - Use **subspace** for a more general term.
  
- **Framework**:  
  - A decomposition problem has no solution if the target vector is not in the subspace spanned by the decomposition vectors.
  - **Concise Statement**:  
    - A decomposition problem does not have a solution if:
      $$ C \notin \text{span}(\{A, B, \dots, Z\}) $$

## 5. Toward an Algorithmic Solution

- **Key Question**:  
  - How to determine if a target vector lies in the span of decomposition vectors?
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Start with intuitive or special cases to develop understanding.
  2. Progress toward a systematic approach using Gaussian elimination.
  3. Explore insightful examples in:
     - Polynomials.
     - $\mathbb{R}^n$ (general vector spaces).

- **Next Steps**:  
  - Upcoming videos will cover:
    - Examples with polynomials.
    - Examples in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    - Techniques for identifying or describing the span of vectors.
