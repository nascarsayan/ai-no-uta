# Matrix Inverse and Its Properties

## 1. Introduction to Matrix Inverse

- The inverse of a matrix is the final piece of matrix algebra, completing its operations.
- The discussion unfolds in multiple videos:
  - Big idea behind the inverse.
  - Algorithms for calculating the inverse.
  - Certain mathematical properties.
  - Cases where inverse is impossible or unsuitable.

## 2. Solving a Linear System with Matrix Inverse

### Matrix Interpretation for Linear Systems:
Given the equation:
$$A \cdot X = B$$  
Where:
- $A$: Known Matrix.
- $X$: Unknown Matrix (solution).
- $B$: Known Matrix (result).

### Transformation to Solve:
- Multiply both sides of the equation by another matrix on the **left**.
- This special matrix, called the **inverse of $A$**, denoted as $A^{-1}$, satisfies:
  $$A^{-1} \cdot A = I$$  
  Where $I$ is the identity matrix.

### Why Use the Identity Matrix?  
- The identity matrix leaves the multiplied matrix unchanged:
  $$I \cdot X = X$$

## 3. Big Idea of Matrix Inverse

### Algebraic Solution Framework:
- Multiplying both sides by $A^{-1}$:
  $$A^{-1} \cdot (A \cdot X) = A^{-1} \cdot B$$  
- Rearranged:
  $$I \cdot X = A^{-1} \cdot B$$  
- Result:
  $$X = A^{-1} \cdot B$$  

### Analogy with Scalar Equation:
Linear systems extend the idea of solving simple equations like:
$$5x = 4$$  
By dividing:
$$x = \frac{4}{5}$$  

For matrices:
- Instead of division, matrix multiplication is used:
  $$X = A^{-1} \cdot B$$

## 4. Computing $A^{-1}$: Associativity in Matrix Multiplication

### Key Properties:
- Associativity ensures consistent ordering of matrix multiplication.
- Example scenario:
  - $(A \cdot X) \cdot A^{-1}$ transforms into $A \cdot (X \cdot A^{-1})$.

### Geometric Perspective:
- Matrix multiplication often relies on linear combinations of rows or columns.

## 5. Practice Calculation: Verifying the Inverse

### Test Identity Matrix:
- Compute:
  $$A \cdot A^{-1}$$  
- Result should yield:
  $$A \cdot A^{-1} = I$$  

### Verification Steps:
1. Multiply columns of $A$ with rows of $A^{-1}$.
2. Apply linear combinations based on matrix entries.
3. Ensure resulting matrix matches the identity matrix.

## 6. Solving for $X$: Using $A^{-1}$

### Formula:
$$X = A^{-1} \cdot B$$  

### Example Calculation:
Given $A^{-1}$ and $B$, compute the entries of $X$:
- First entry:
  $$-4 + 25 = 1$$  
- Second entry:
  $$55 - 50 = 1$$  
- Third entry:
  $$24 + 25 = 1$$  

### Result:
$$X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

## 7. Mathematical Insights into $A^{-1}$

### Importance of $A^{-1}$:
- Central to matrix algebra as it enables solving linear systems.
  
### Non-commutativity in Matrix Operations:
- Matrix multiplication isn't commutative:
  $$A^{-1} \cdot A \neq A \cdot A^{-1}$$  

### Left vs. Right Inverse:
- Left inverse: $A^{-1} \cdot A = I$
- Right inverse: $A \cdot A^{-1} = I$
- Typically these differ unless exceptional circumstances arise.
