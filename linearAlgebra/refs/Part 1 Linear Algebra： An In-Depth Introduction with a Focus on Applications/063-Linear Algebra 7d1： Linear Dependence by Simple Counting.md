## Linear Dependence in $\mathbb{R}^3$

### Problem Statement
Are these vectors from $\mathbb{R}^3$ linearly dependent?  

### Initial Insight
- Direct guessing of a linear combination or expressing one vector as a combination of the others is practically infeasible due to the complexity of the numbers.  
- Observing the structure of the vectors:  
  - The **last entry** of each vector is the **sum of the first two** entries.  

### Key Insight
- This property is characteristic of a **linear subspace**, meaning:  
  - These vectors belong to a **subspace** where the last entry is equal to the sum of the first two.  

### Subspace Characteristics
1. **Smaller than $\mathbb{R}^3$:**  
   - The subspace is a proper subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$, meaning it is contained in $\mathbb{R}^3$, but its dimension is less than 3.  
   - Vectors like $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$ (where the last entry isn't the sum of the first two) **do not** belong to this subspace.  
2. **Dimension Reduction:**  
   - A subspace smaller than $\mathbb{R}^3$ has a dimension strictly less than 3.  
   - By geometric intuition, the largest subspace smaller than $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a **plane** (dimension = 2).  

### Logical Chain of Reasoning
1. The vectors belong to a linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.  
2. This subspace is **exactly two-dimensional** (a plane).  
3. Having **three vectors** in a two-dimensional subspace makes them **necessarily linearly dependent**.  

### Dimensional Argument in Linear Algebra
#### Theorem:
In linear algebra, if a subspace is a proper subspace of a larger space, its dimension must be less than that of the larger space.

#### Geometric Visualization:
- $\mathbb{R}^3$: Entire space (dimension 3).  
- Plane: Largest subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and has dimension 2.  
- Line: A smaller subspace with dimension 1.  
Thus, for the given set of vectors, the subspace they span (where the last entry = sum of the first two) fits within a plane.

### Gaussian Elimination to Verify Dependency
Using Gaussian elimination to deduce a linear combination later:  
Let the vectors be $A$, $B$, and $C$. Then, one possible expression is:  

$$
A = -\frac{195}{8} B + \frac{199}{8} C
$$  

Clearly, this demonstrates the dependency, but this calculation is unnecessary for reasoning.

### Summary
Without explicit calculation, the following conclusion is reached:
- The vectors lie in a **subspace** that is at most two-dimensional.  
- A set of **three vectors** in a two-dimensional subspace is necessarily **linearly dependent**.  

### Key Takeaway
This problem illustrates the **power of reasoning in linear algebra**:  
- Without needing specific calculations (e.g., Gaussian elimination), logical deduction based on dimension and structure yields a clear and robust solution.  
- Linear algebra combines algebraic properties with geometric intuition to arrive at qualitative conclusions.  

### Final Conclusion
These vectors are **linearly dependent**, showcasing the elegance and robustness of linear algebra reasoning.
