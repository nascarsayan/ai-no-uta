## Expressing Arbitrary Vectors as Linear Combinations

### Objectives:
- Show how to express an arbitrary vector in the plane as a linear combination of two vectors, $A$ and $B$, provided that $A$ and $B$ point in different directions (i.e., they do not lie along the same line).

---

### Spanning the Plane:
- Two vectors $A$ and $B$ that do not point in the same direction can span the entire plane.
- Any vector in the plane can be written as a linear combination of these two vectors:
$$
\text{Vector }\mathbf{v} = \alpha \mathbf{A} + \beta \mathbf{B},
$$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are scalars (coefficients).

---

### Systematic Approach for Decomposition:
Finding $\alpha$ and $\beta for a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in terms of $A$ and $B$:
1. Identify sets of vectors in the plane that are easy to decompose concerning $A$ and $B$.
2. Use systematic methods involving coordinate grids to estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ accurately.

### Using Skewed Coordinate Grids:
#### Fix $\alpha = 1$:
- Draw lines through coordinates that 0 easilyestimers are coefficients gridations grid
