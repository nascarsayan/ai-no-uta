## The Indian Approach to Determinants

### Key Concept
The Indian approach focuses on expansion by a row or column, making it a specialized case of the more general method of determinant computation (row or column expansion). Here's how it works step-by-step.

---

### Step 1: Selecting a Row or Column

- **Choose a particular row or column** to expand the determinant. Let's assume we choose the first row for simplicity.

---

### Step 2: Corresponding Terms and 2x2 Determinants

- Each entry in the chosen row contributes a term. For example, expanding by the first row of a matrix:

    ```
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\
    4 & 5 & 6 \\
    7 & 8 & 9 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    ```

- **Term for the first row entry `1`:**
  - Mentally cross out the first row and column.
  - The remaining matrix is:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    5 & 6 \\
    8 & 9
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
  - Compute the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:
    $$
    5 \times 9 - 6 \times 8 = 45 - 48 = -3
    $$

- **Term for the second row entry `2`:**
  - Cross out the first row and second column.
  - The remaining matrix is:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 & 6 \\
    7 & 9
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
  - Compute the determinant:
    $$
    4 \times 9 - 6 \times 7 = 36 - 42 = -6
    $$
  - **Important:** Remember to alternate signs! The second term is:
    $$ - (-6) = +6 $$

- **Term for the third row entry `3`:**
  - Cross out the first row and third column.
  - The remaining matrix is:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 & 5 \\
    7 & 8
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
  - Compute the determinant:
    $$
    4 \times 8 - 5 \times 7 = 32 - 35 = -3
    $$

---

### Step 3: Summing Up Contributions

- Add all partial determinants accounting for their respective signs:
  $$
  1 \times (-3) + 2 \times (+6) + 3 \times (-3) = -3 + 12 - 9 = 0
  $$

### Efficiency of the Indian Approach

1. **Mental Determinant Calculation:** The approach allows you to compute 2x2 determinants mentally without needing to write them down.
2. **Sign Alternation:** Be cautious of the alternating signs (+, -, +) while computing.
3. **Least Writing:** Compared to other approaches, this requires minimal writing and computation.

---

### Alternate Perspective

- You can verify the results by multiplying out every term:
  - $1 \cdot 5 \cdot 9 - 1 \cdot 6 \cdot 8$ (matches first term).
  - $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 9 - 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 7$ (matches second term).
  - $3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 - 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$ (matches third term).

---

### General Observations

- **Sign Alternation:** Always applies (+,-,+,-,...).
- **Pivot Element:** In the chosen row/column, compute determinants by mentally removing respective row/column.
- **Simplification:** Once practiced, the steps can be executed quickly with minimal effort.

### Final Result for Our Example

The determinant of the matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
= 0
$$
