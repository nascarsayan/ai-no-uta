## Proving Signed Area, Volume, and Their Connection to Determinants

### 1. Connection Between Signed Area/Volume and Determinants

We want to prove the remarkable and profound fact:

The **signed area** of a parallelogram (from two vectors in a plane) and the **signed volume** of a parallelepiped (from three vectors in 3D space) equals the **determinant** of the matrix formed by those vectors' components.

- This relationship is central to applied mathematics, bringing algebra and geometry together.

#### Definitions:
- **Signed Area (2D)**:
    - Equals the conventional area (absolute value).
    - The **sign** depends on the order of the vectors:
        - **Counterclockwise order**: Positive orientation.
        - **Clockwise order**: Negative orientation.

- **Signed Volume (3D)**:
    - Equals the conventional volume (absolute value).
    - The **sign** depends on the orientation of the vector set.
        - Positive for **counterclockwise** (using right-hand rule).
        - Negative for **clockwise**.

### 2. Signed Area and Volume via Basis Orientation

#### Examples:

1. **2D Basis**:
    - Vectors $\mathbf{e_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{e_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
    - The determinant of the basis is $1$, and the signed area of the unit square is also $1$.

2. **3D Basis**:
    - Vectors $\mathbf{e_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\mathbf{e_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\mathbf{e_3} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
    - The determinant of the 3D basis is $1$, and the signed volume of the unit cube is also $1$.

#### Summary:
- Signed area/volume matches determinant if the basis is:
  - A **positively oriented set**.
  - Produces a unit signed area/volume.

### 3. Properties of Determinants and Signed Measures

#### Key Properties:
1. **Identity Property**:
   - Signed area or volume is $1$ for the identity basis.
   - Matches the determinant.

2. **Alternating Property**:
   - Switching the order of vectors flips the sign:
     - Signed areas/volumes change sign just like determinants.

3. **Linearity Property**:
   - Scaling a vector scales area/volume by the same factor.
     - $\text{Determinant of } k \mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}, \ldots = k (\text{Determinant of } \mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}, \ldots)$.

#### Visualization of Alternation and Scaling:
1. **2D Flip**:
    - Switching the order of vectors flips signed area:
      $$
      A = 
      \begin{vmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 \end{vmatrix} = - 
      \begin{vmatrix} b_1 & a_1 \\ b_2 & a_2 \end{vmatrix}.
      $$

2. **Scaling in 3D**:
    - Doubling vector $\mathbf{v_3}$ doubles the parallelepiped volume.

#### Linearity of Signed Area:
If a vector $\mathbf{b}$ is decomposed as $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b_1} + \mathbf{b_2}$:
- The signed area of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ equals the sum of areas formed by $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b_1}$, and $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b_2}$:
    $$
    \text{Signed Area of } \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} = 
    \text{Area of } \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b_1} + \text{Area of } \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b_2}.
    $$

### 4. Visualization of Composition of Signed Areas

- When $\mathbf{b}$ is split into two parts (e.g., vectors $\mathbf{b_1}$ and $\mathbf{b_2}$):
    - The two smaller parallelograms (built on $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b_1}$ and $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b_2}$) perfectly add up to the original parallelogram (built on $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}$).

- For example:
    $$
    \text{Determinant of } [\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{b}] = 
    \text{Determinant of } [\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{b_1}] + 
    \text{Determinant of } [\mathbf{a} | \mathbf{b_2}].
    $$

### 5. Higher Dimensions and Determinants

- The proof for 3D volumes (parallelepiped addition using determinants) is analogous but involves slightly more complex geometry.
- The **signed volumes** in 3D similarly align with determinant properties (switching, scaling, linearity).

### Final Thoughts

This connection between **algebra (determinants)** and **geometry (signed area/volume)** is a remarkable synthesis:
- Using basic determinant rules, any system of vectors' areas/volumes can be calculated with precision.
