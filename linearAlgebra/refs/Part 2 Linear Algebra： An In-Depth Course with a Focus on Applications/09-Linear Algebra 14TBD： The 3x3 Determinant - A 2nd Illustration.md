# Notes: Determinants and Approaches

## 1. Introduction

### Context
- The lesson demonstrates three methods for computing a determinant of a $3 \times 3$ matrix:
    1. **Russian Approach**
    2. **American Approach**
    3. **Indian Approach**

## 2. Russian Approach

### Procedure Summary
- Focuses on pattern recognition:
    - Identify **3 positive terms**.
    - Identify **3 negative terms**.

### Positive Terms
1. Main diagonal: $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 = 9$.
2. Triangle with a side parallel to the main diagonal: $0$ (contributes $0$ due to a $0$ in the mix).
3. Additional triangle with a base parallel to the main diagonal: $(-1) \cdot (-1) \cdot 1 = 1$.

#### Sum of Positive Terms:  
$$
9 + 1 = 10
$$

### Negative Terms
1. Opposite diagonal: $-3$.
2. Triangle with a side parallel to the opposite diagonal: $-6 \, \text{(from } (-1) \cdot (-2) \cdot 3)$.
3. Additional triangle with a base parallel to the opposite diagonal: $0$ (contributes $0$ due to a $0$ in the mix).

#### Sum of Negative Terms:  
$$
-3 + (-6) = -9
$$

### Final Determinant
$$
\text{Determinant} = \text{Sum of Positive Terms} - \text{Sum of Negative Terms}
$$  

$$
10 - 9 = 1
$$

### Key Takeaways
- The Russian approach emphasizes visual patterns and identifying geometric relationships.  
- Effective but requires practice to expedite the process.

## 3. American Approach

### Procedure Summary
- Focuses on replicating parts of the matrix for systematic calculation:
    - **Repeat the first two columns** of the matrix to the right.
    - Perform operations on visible diagonal patterns.

### Positive Terms
1. Main diagonal: $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 = 9$.
2. First triangle diagonal pattern: $1 \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) = 1$.
3. Second triangle diagonal pattern: $0$ (contributes $0$ due to a $0$ in the mix).

#### Sum of Positive Terms:  
$$
9 + 1 + 0 = 10
$$

### Negative Terms
1. Opposite diagonal: $-3$.
2. First negative triangle diagonal pattern: $-6 \, \text{(from } (-1) \cdot (-2) \cdot 3)$.
3. Second negative triangle diagonal pattern: $0$ (contributes $0$ due to a $0$ in the mix).

#### Sum of Negative Terms:  
$$
-3 + (-6) + 0 = -9
$$

### Final Determinant
$$
\text{Determinant} = \text{Sum of Positive Terms} - \text{Sum of Negative Terms}
$$

$$
10 - 9 = 1
$$

### Key Takeaways
- The American approach is a **systematic and repeatable method**.  
- Requires more writing but involves less pattern recognition.

## 4. Indian Approach

### Procedure Summary
- Focuses on **column or row expansion**:
    - Leveraging the presence of $0$s to simplify calculations.
    - Expand along rows or columns containing $0$s to eliminate calculations for related terms.

### Example Calculation
1. Expand along the first column since it contains a $0$.  
2. Remaining **non-zero contributions**:
    - $3 \cdot (+ \text{minor determinant}) = 3 \cdot (1)$  
        (minor determinant is $1$ after regular $2 \times 2$ calculations).  
    - $1 \cdot (+ \text{minor determinant}) = 1 \cdot (-2)$  
        (minor determinant is $-2$ after regular $2 \times 2$ calculations).

### Final Determinant
$$
\text{Determinant} = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (-2)
$$

$$
3 - 2 = 1
$$

### Key Takeaways
- The Indian approach focuses on **efficiency and leveraging $0$s** whenever possible.
- Particularly effective for matrices with several $0$s.

## 5. Final Comparison of Methods

| Approach  | Positive Aspects                     | Challenges                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Russian   | Intuitive for visual learners.       | Needs practice and pattern recognition. |
| American  | Systematic and reliable.            | Requires more writing.            |
| Indian    | Efficient when $0$s are present.    | Involves concepts of minor determinants. |

### Conclusion:  
The **Indian Approach** is the most efficient when there is a $0$ in the matrix, saving both time and effort.
