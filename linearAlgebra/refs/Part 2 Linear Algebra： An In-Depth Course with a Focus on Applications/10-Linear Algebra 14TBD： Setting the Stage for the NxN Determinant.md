## Determinants: Foundations and Strategies

### 1. Introduction to Determinants
- The goal is to define determinants for square matrices of arbitrary size \( n \times n \).
- An overarching objective is to establish an **algebraic expression** that:
  - Evaluates to zero if the matrix is **singular**.
  - Evaluates to a nonzero value otherwise.
- Historical context:
  - Determinants for \( 2 \times 2 \) and \( 3 \times 3 \) matrices have been well-established.
  - Even \( 1 \times 1 \) determinants are simple: **The determinant of a \( 1 \times 1 \) matrix is its only entry**.

### 2. Determinants as a Measure of Singular Matrices
- For a \( 1 \times 1 \) matrix \( A = [a] \):
  - \( |\text{det}(A)| = a \).
  - Singular if \( a = 0 \) (linearly dependent "trivial" column vector).
  - Non-singular otherwise.
- This framework naturally scales to \( n = 2, 3 \), and beyond.

### 3. Strategies for Determining Determinants
#### \( 3 \times 3 \) Determinants
- A robust formula exists for \( 3 \times 3 \) matrices:
  - Relatively concise but **not trivial to memorize**.
  - Practical techniques (e.g., cofactor expansion) can be applied without brute memorization.

#### \( 4 \times 4 \) Determinants
- **Gaussian Elimination Approach**:
  - Assume the element \( a \neq 0 \).
  - Eliminate entries below \( a \) using Gaussian elimination to generate a \( 3 \times 3 \) submatrix.
  - Apply the already-established \( 3 \times 3 \) formula to the submatrix.
  - Multiply back by \( a \) to construct the determinant.
- **Outcome**:
  - The formula is robust but increasingly complex, with **24 terms**:
    - 12 terms have a \( + \) sign.
    - 12 terms have a \( - \) sign.
  - Each term is a product of **4 entries** from the matrix.

### 4. Generalizing Determinants
#### Patterns of Complexity
- Term count grows **factorially** (\( n! \)):
  - \( 1 \): \( 1 \times 1 \) determinant.
  - \( 2 \): \( 2! = 2 \), i.e., 2 terms.
  - \( 3 \): \( 3! = 6 \), i.e., 6 terms.
  - \( 4 \): \( 4! = 24 \), i.e., 24 terms.
  - \( 5 \): \( 5! = 120 \), i.e., 120 terms.
  - Higher dimensions (\( n > 6 \)):
    - Practically **impossible** for manual computation.
    - \( 10 \times 10 \): Over \( 3.2 \) million terms.
    - \( 100 \times 100 \): Astronomically large ("googol-term complexity").

#### Computational Considerations
- Modern computation allows determinant evaluation via algorithms, **not manual expansion**.
- The \( n! \)-term formula:
  - **Robust** but **impractical** due to growing complexity.
  - Useful for deriving properties, though direct evaluation is avoided for large \( n \).

---

### 5. Alternative Perspectives: Properties Over Formulas
- Determinants aren't directly evaluated using the \( n! \)-term formula due to complexity.
- Instead:
  - **Properties** of determinants are derived from the general formula.
  - Practical applications use highly optimized computational strategies.
- Analogy with Calculus:
  - The **definite integral** is defined through Riemann sums (limit of partial sums).
  - Actual computation uses the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, not the original definition.

---

### 6. Patterns and Observations
- In an \( n \times n \) determinant:
  - Fractional "ownership" of terms by elements:
    - \( 3 \times 3 \): \( A, B, C \) each contribute \( \frac{1}{3} \) of terms.
    - \( 4 \times 4 \): \( A, B, C, D \) each contribute \( \frac{1}{4} \) of terms.
  - General persistence:
    - Each row element contributes \( \frac{1}{n} \) of total terms.

---

### 7. Formulation Approaches
#### Approach 1: Formula-First
- Define the general \( n \times n \) determinant algebraically (\( n! \)-terms).
- Derive properties of determinants as **consequences**.

#### Approach 2: Property-First  
- **Specify core properties** of the determinant a priori (e.g., linearity, alternating sign).
- Use these properties to **prove the \( n! \)-term formula is inevitable**.
- Example: Popularized by figures like Gilbert Strang, emphasizing conceptual clarity with determinant properties as primary.

---

### 8. Our Path Forward
- Key steps:
  1. Present the **properties of determinants**.
  2. Introduce the **general formula** using \( n! \).
  3. Derive properties using this formula.
  4. Transition to practical uses, leveraging computer-based evaluation.
- Objective: Balance mathematical rigor and computational feasibility.
