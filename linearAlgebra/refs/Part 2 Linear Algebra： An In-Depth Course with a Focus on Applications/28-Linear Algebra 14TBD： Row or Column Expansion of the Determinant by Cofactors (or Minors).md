# Notes: Row or Column Expansion for Determinants

## 1. Introduction to Row/Column Expansion
- A technique for evaluating determinants.
- Also known as:
  - Expansion by co-factors or minors.
  - The Laplace expansion.
- For a $3 \times 3$ determinant, it is equivalent to the "Indian method" often taught in some regions.

## 2. General Approach
### The Core Idea
- Works for **any row or column** in the matrix.
- Expansion takes the determinant of the matrix and expresses it as the **sum of $N$ terms**, where $N$ aligns with the size of the determinant (for example, $3$ terms for a $3 \times 3$ matrix).  
- Terms are formed by:
  1. Choosing an entry from the row or column.
  2. **Crossing out** the corresponding row and column.
  3. Remaining determinant (smaller matrix obtained) is a sub-determinant termed as the **minor** for that entry.
  4. Determinant value comes by multiplying this minor with the chosen entry (including signed factors).

### Alternating Signs
- The terms include **alternating signs**:
  - First entry: $+$ sign.
  - Second entry: $-$ sign.
  - Subsequent terms alternate between $+$ and $-$.

### Signs Applied: Example for First Row
For the first row:  
$+ \quad - \quad + \quad -$  
For the second row:  
$- \quad + \quad - \quad +$

## 3. Example: Expanding a $4 \times 4$ Determinant
### Steps
- Assume a $4 \times 4$ determinant (matrix) where first-row entries are $[a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}]$.
- The determinant can be written as:

$$
\text{Determinant} 
= a_{11} \cdot \text{Minor}_{11} - a_{12} \cdot \text{Minor}_{12} + a_{13} \cdot \text{Minor}_{13} - a_{14} \cdot \text{Minor}_{14}
$$

Here:
- $\text{Minor}_{ij}$ represents the determinant of the sub-matrix when the $i$-th row and $j$-th column are crossed out.

### Illustration
1. Pick the first row.
2. Write down the alternating signs.
3. Compute sub-determinants for each entry, crossing out their respective row and column.
4. Multiply the entry by its corresponding sub-determinant and sign.
5. Add all these terms together.

For a hypothetical example:

$$
\text{Determinant}
= a \cdot 
\begin{vmatrix}
e & f & h \\ 
i & j & k \\ 
m & n & o
\end{vmatrix}
- b \cdot 
\begin{vmatrix}
d & f & h \\ 
h & j & k \\ 
n & n&o|.
