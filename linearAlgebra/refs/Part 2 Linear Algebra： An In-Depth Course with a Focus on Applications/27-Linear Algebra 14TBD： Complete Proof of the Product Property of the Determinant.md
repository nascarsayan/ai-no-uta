## Proof of Determinant Property for General Matrices

### Context
- The proof discusses the property of the determinant: $\det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)$ for square matrices $A$ and $B$.
- It extends a prior proof where $A$ was an *elementary matrix*.

### Key Points of the Proof

1. **Elementary Matrices and Products**:
   - Recall: Any square nonsingular matrix $A$ can be expressed as the product of elementary matrices:
     $$
     A = E_1 \cdot E_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot E_k
     $$
   - Non-singular square matrices satisfy this representation.

2. **Special Case Setup**:
   - If $A$ is singular, $\det(A)$ and $\det(AB)$ are $0$ (by properties of singular matrices). Therefore, $\det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)$ trivially holds.

3. **General Case**:
   - For nonsingular $A$, its determinant can be analyzed using its decomposition into elementary matrices:
     $$
     A = E_1 \cdot E_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot E_k
     $$

### Recursive Application of Determinants

1. **Determinant of a Product**:
   - Consider the product $AB$ where $A$ is represented as:
     $$
     AB = (E_1 \cdot E_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot E_k)B
     $$
   - Applying properties of determinants, start with the first elementary matrix $E_1$:
     $$
     \det(AB) = \det(E_1 \cdot (E_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot E_k \cdot B))
     $$
   - Using the determinant property for an elementary matrix:
     $$
     \det(E_1 \cdot X) = \det(E_1) \cdot \det(X)
     $$

2. **Iterative Process**:
   - Repeat this reasoning for all elementary matrices:
     $$
     \det(E_1 \cdot (E_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot E_k \cdot B)) = \det(E_1) \cdot \det(E_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot E_k \cdot B)
     $$
   - Continue until the full determinant expression is:
     $$
     \det(AB) = \det(E_1) \cdot \det(E_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot \det(E_k) \cdot \det(B)
     $$

3. **Combine Results**:
   - The product of the determinants of the elementary matrices gives $\det(A)$:
     $$
     \det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)
     $$

### Final Considerations

- **Reversing the Formula**:
   - The property $\det(E_1 \cdot E_2 \cdot \ldots)$ was applied from left to right during decomposition. To properly handle the full product, careful consideration of the order of multiplication and determinants is required.

- **Conclusion**:
   - The proof is now generalized for *any nonsingular matrices $A$ and $B$*, making $\det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)$ a firmly established theorem.

### Key Takeaways

1. Singular matrices trivially satisfy the property since their determinant is $0$.
2. For nonsingular matrices, decomposition into elementary matrices enables recursive application of the determinant property.
3. Determinants break down nicely into products when matrices are expressed as products of simpler (elementary) matrices.
