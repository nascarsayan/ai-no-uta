## American Approach to $3 \times 3$ Determinants

### Overview
The American approach simplifies the computation of $3 \times 3$ determinants by avoiding the need to recognize complex Russian patterns. Instead, it rewrites the determinant in a way that relies on extending the determinant grid for easier computation.

### Steps in the Approach

#### 1. Extend the Determinant
- Repeat the first two columns of the determinant matrix to the right outside the original determinant grid.

For example, given:

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i
\end{vmatrix}
$$

You extend it to:

$$
\begin{matrix}
a & b & c & a & b \\
d & e & f & d & e \\
g & h & i & g & h
\end{matrix}
$$

#### 2. Positive Patterns
- The three positive terms are calculated from diagonal patterns going **down and to the right**.

The positive patterns are:

1. $a \cdot e \cdot i$
2. $b \cdot f \cdot g$
3. $c \cdot d \cdot h$

---

#### 3. Negative Patterns
- The three negative terms are calculated from diagonal patterns going **up and to the right**.

The negative patterns are:

1. $g \cdot e \cdot c$
2. $h \cdot f \cdot a$
3. $i \cdot d \cdot b$

---

### Computation Formula
With the positive and negative patterns identified, the determinant is computed as:

$$
\text{Determinant} = (a \cdot e \cdot i + b \cdot f \cdot g + c \cdot d \cdot h) - (g \cdot e \cdot c + h \cdot f \cdot a + i \cdot d \cdot b)
$$

### Advantages of the American Approach
1. **Simplifies Patterns**: Avoids the need to memorize abstract Russian patterns. Patterns become straight diagonal lines.
2. **Universality**: Works effectively for beginners and minimizes confusion.

### Drawbacks of the American Approach
1. **More Writing**: Rewriting the determinant with repeated columns can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
2. **Lesser Cognitive Engagement**: Reduces the mental processing required, which might lead to a loss of focus in broader problem-solving contexts.
3. **Not Necessarily Simpler**: While the lines are straight, the patterns are still recognizable in the original determinant without grid extension, making the method less inherently advantageous for experienced users.
4. **Inefficiency**: In more complex problems, techniques like Gaussian elimination are quicker, more reliable, and preferred.

### Final Thoughts
- The American approach is a helpful tool for beginners who find traditional methods challenging.
- However, as one gains proficiency, leveraging Gaussian elimination or direct computation of patterns becomes more efficient.
- Ultimately, use the method that feels most natural and intuitive for your learning and problem-solving process.
