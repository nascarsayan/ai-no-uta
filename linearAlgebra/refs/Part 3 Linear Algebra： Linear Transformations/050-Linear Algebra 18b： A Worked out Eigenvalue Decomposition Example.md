## Eigenvalue Decomposition: Completing the Calculation

### Overview:
- In this lesson, we finish calculating the eigenvalue decomposition for a matrix introduced earlier.
- The goal is to compute the inverse of the matrix $\mathbf{X}$ in the decomposition $\mathbf{X} \Lambda \mathbf{X}^{-1}$, after finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Key Points:

1. **Why Compute the Inverse of $\mathbf{X}$?**
    - Even after deriving eigenvalues and eigenvectors, decomposing a matrix into $\mathbf{X} \Lambda \mathbf{X}^{-1}$ requires computing $\mathbf{X}^{-1}$.
    - The matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is invertible because:
        - The original matrix has a full set of eigenvalues (\textit{i.e.}, it is diagonalizable).
        - The eigenvectors are linearly independent, and therefore the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ are linearly independent.

2. **Steps for Computing $\mathbf{X}^{-1}$:**
    - Using algorithmic or computational methods (e.g., Gaussian elimination), the inverse is calculated in subsequent steps.
    - The completion of this task illustrates that additional computational effort is often required in matrix decompositions.

3. **Why is $\mathbf{X}$ Invertible?**
    - **Assumption:** The original matrix has a full set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
    - Since the eigenvectors are linearly independent, $\mathbf{X}$ (whose columns are these eigenvectors) is a nonsingular matrix and hence has an inverse.

### Final Computation:

- After computing $\mathbf{X}^{-1}$, the decomposition is completed:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X} \Lambda \mathbf{X}^{-1}
$$

This concludes the eigenvalue decomposition for the given matrix.
