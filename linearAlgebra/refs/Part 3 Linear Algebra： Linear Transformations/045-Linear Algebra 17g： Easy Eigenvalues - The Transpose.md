## Properties of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Matrix and Its Transpose

### Key Insights

1. **Matrices $A$ and $A^\top$**:
   - May not share the same eigenvectors.
   - Always share identical eigenvalues.

### Example Analysis

Let us examine a matrix to identify its eigenvalues based on specific properties.

---

### Observing Special Properties

#### Diagonal Position of $10$

- Matrix $A$ has the number $10$ alone in its row and at a diagonal position.
- Why is this helpful?
  - If we take the transpose of matrix $A$, $10$:
    - Stays in the diagonal position.
    - Becomes alone in its column.
  - Thus, $10$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix \( A \), and the corresponding eigenvector is \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

---

#### Rows and Columns Adding Up to $5$

- In matrix $A$, every column sums to $5$.
- After transposing \( A \), every row will sum to $5$.
  - This indicates $5$ is another eigenvalue.
- For the transpose of \( A \), the corresponding eigenvector is \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

**Important Note**:
- When looking at the transpose, the eigenvalue remains, but the eigenvector may not correspond directly.

---

### Using the Trace to Determine the Third Eigenvalue

- The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements, which gives the sum of all eigenvalues.
- Sum of all eigenvalues = $13$ (trace of matrix \( A \)).
- Two eigenvalues identified:
  $$
  10 + 5 = 15
  $$
- The third eigenvalue must satisfy:
  $$
  \lambda_3 = 13 - 15 = -2
  $$

---

### Summary of Identified Values
- Eigenvalues: \( 10, 5, -2 \).
- Corresponding eigenvectors:
  - \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) for \( 10 \) (transpose considered).
  - \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) for \( 5 \) (transpose considered).
  - The eigenvector for \( -2 \) requires additional work and was not calculated here.

---

### Final Reflection

- Identifying eigenvalues based on the combination of special properties (diagonal elements and row/column sums) is straightforward.
- Determining corresponding eigenvectors often requires additional effort beyond elementary observations.
- The property that matrices $A$ and \( A^\top \) share identical eigenvalues, while not independently sufficient, can be powerful when combined with observed matrix features.
