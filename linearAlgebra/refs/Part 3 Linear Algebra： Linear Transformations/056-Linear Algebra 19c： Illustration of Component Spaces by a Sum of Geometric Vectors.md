## Illustrating Component Spaces with Vectors

### Geometric vs Component Spaces
- Vectors exist in "parallel worlds":
  - **Real-life geometric vectors**: abstract and basis-free.
  - **Component spaces**: vectors represented as coordinates/numbers within a chosen basis.

---

### 1. Basis-Free Addition
- Addition without reference to any basis:
  - Use the **parallelogram rule** or **tip-to-tail** method.

**Example**:
The sum of two vectors $A$ and $B$ produces a resultant vector, $A + B$, in the geometric space:
  
1. Visualize $A$ and $B$ in a vector diagram.
2. Apply the parallelogram rule to find their sum in geometric space.

Result: **No reference to a basis was made**.

### 2. Transforming into a Component Space
- To work in the component space, a basis must be defined.
- A **basis** is a set of reference vectors (e.g., $E_1$, $E_2$):
  - $B = \{E_1, E_2\}$ where vectors are decomposed into coordinates relative to the basis.

#### Decomposing Vector $A$
Given basis $B = \{E_1, E_2\}$:
  
$$
A = 0E_1 - 1E_2 \implies A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}_B
$$

#### Decomposing Vector $B$
Similarly:
  
$$
B = \frac{1}{2}E_1 + E_2 \implies B = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}_B
$$

#### Component Addition in Basis $B$
Add $A$ and $B$ in component form:
  
$$
A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}_B + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}_B = 
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}_B
$$

Interpretation: This represents a **linear combination** of basis vectors.

#### Verifying Back in Geometric Space
Using the original geometric vectors, the resultant vector aligns perfectly with the sum computed in the component space. **The consistency confirms correctness.**

### 3. Exploring a New Basis
- Introduce a new basis $F = \{F_1, F_2\}$. 
- Decompose $A$ and $B$ with respect to $F$.

#### New Component Representation of $A$ and $B$
Assume $A$ and $B$ are decomposed relative to the new basis:
  
$$
A = -F_1 + F_2 \implies A_F = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}_F
$$

$$
B = -2F_1 + F_2 \implies B_F = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}_F
$$

#### Component Addition in Basis $F$
Add them in the component space:

$$
A + B = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}_F + \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}_F = 
\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}_F
$$

Confirming Real-World Consistency:
1. Multiply basis vectors $F_1, F_2$ by their respective components.
2. Apply vector addition in geometric space.
3. Result matches the original geometric sum.

### 4. Observations on Changing Bases
- **Intermediate components** change when switching bases, but the overall vector remains the same.
- The **real-world vector result** is independent of the basis used.
- Basis choice is arbitrary:
  - Vectors can be reconstructed by changing the basis back to geometric space.

#### Key Takeaways:
- The equality $A = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}_B$ is basis-dependent.
- Component spaces simplify operations like addition but ultimately relate back to geometric vectors.

---

### 5. General Steps for Solving with Component Spaces
1. **Choose a basis**:
   - Decompose all vectors relative to it.
2. **Perform operations in the component space**:
   - Use regular addition, subtraction, etc.
3. **Convert results back to real-world geometric vectors**:
   - Reconstruct vectors by summing results as linear combinations of the basis vectors.

This three-step approach is common in linear algebra, especially for complex problems.

---

### 6. Conclusion
- All bases are created equal:
  - Any basis provides the same vector result despite intermediate differences in components.
- This exercise demonstrates the flexibility and consistency of working with component spaces.
- Applications include real-life problems where **direct geometric visualization** becomes impractical.
