# Notes on Linear Transformations Representation in Component Spaces

---

## 1. Introduction to Component Spaces and Linear Transformations

- **Goal**: Discuss the representation of linear transformations in component spaces.
- **Motivation**: Some linear transformations require component space representation to determine eigenvalues effectively.
- **Practical Benefit**: Linear transformations often involve complex problems that are simplified using component spaces.

---

## 2. Example: Reflection as a Linear Transformation

- We'll use **reflection** of a vector \( \mathbf{v} \) as the demonstration.
- Geometric intuition of reflection is well-known, but the focus here will be its **representation in component space**.

---

## 3. Steps for Component Space Representation

### Step 1: Choose a Basis 
- Select a **basis \( B \)** natural to the problem:
  - If reflecting over a line at an arbitrary angle, a Cartesian basis is not effective.
  - Instead, use a basis aligned with the reflection line (\( e_1 \)) and at a \( 45^\circ \) angle to it (\( e_2 \)), with:
    $$
    e_2 \text{ length } = \sqrt{2} \times \text{ length of } e_1
    $$
- Basis \( B = \{e_1, e_2\} \).

### Step 2: Decompose Vector \( \mathbf{v} \) With Respect to Basis
- Decompose the vector \( \mathbf{v} \) into its components relative to basis \( B \).
- Example:
  - \( B = \{ e_1, e_2 \} \)
  - Components of \( \mathbf{v} \): 
    $$
    \text{Component vector: } c_1 e_1 + c_2 e_2
    $$

### Step 3: Mystery Operation
- To represent the transformation in component space:
  - Apply a linear **transformation matrix** \( A_R \), associated with reflection.
  - This transformation matrix transforms the components of the vector to the reflection's components.

- Matrix \( A_R \):
  $$
  A_R = \text{Matrix representation of reflection transformation w.r.t basis } B
  $$

---

## 4. Construction of the Transformation Matrix \( A_R \)

- Matrix \( A_R \) columns are derived from the **images of the basis vectors under the transformation** \( R \).
  
  ### Algorithm:
  1. Transform each basis vector under the transformation, e.g.:
     $$
     R(e_1) \text{ and } R(e_2)
     $$
  2. Decompose the transformed vectors with respect to the same basis \( B \).
  3. The components of the transformed basis vectors form the columns of \( A_R \).

  ### Example:
  - **Reflection Properties**:
    - \( R(e_1) = e_1 \) (basis vector remains on the reflection line).
    - \( R(e_2) = 2e_1 - e_2 \).
  - Resulting matrix:
    $$
    A_R = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    0 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

## 5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Component Space

- Eigenvalues remain invariant under representation in component space:
  - Eigenvalues of \( R \): \( \lambda = 1, -1 \)
  - Corresponding eigenvectors:
    - \( \lambda = 1 \): Vector along \( e_1 \) (reflection axis).
    - \( \lambda = -1 \): Vector orthogonal to \( e_1 \).
  - Eigenvalues of matrix \( A_R \) are the same: \( 1, -1 \).
  
- **Why Use Component Spaces?**
  - Without component spaces, deriving eigenvalues/eigenvectors often requires **geometric trial-and-error** or ingenuity.
  - In component space, numerical algorithms (e.g., for eigenvalues) can easily handle the problem.

---

## 6. The Advantage of Component Spaces

- In component space, we reduce geometric insight to **numerical computation**, making it easier to:
  1. Represent complex transformations.
  2. Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors using robust algorithms.
