## 15. Késki Decomposition

### Introduction

- The **Késki Decomposition** is named after André-Louis Cholesky, who was a French military officer and land surveyor having notable contributions in linear algebra.
- This decomposition has practical applications in areas such as probability, statistics, finance, and Monte Carlo simulations.
- It applies only to **symmetric matrices** with **positive pivots**.

---

### Prerequisite: Symmetric Matrix

- For the decomposition:
  - We need a matrix \( A \) where the **pivots are positive**.
  - Symmetry condition: \( A = A^\top \).

---

### LDU Decomposition and Symmetry

Given a matrix \( A \), we can obtain its LDU decomposition:

$$
A = LDU
$$

- \( L \): The lower triangular matrix.
- \( D \): The diagonal matrix.
- \( U \): The upper triangular matrix.
- If \( A \) is symmetric (\( A = A^\top \)), then \( U = L^\top \).

Thus:

$$
A = L D L^\top
$$

---

### Simplifying the Decomposition with Square Roots

- Instead of having three matrices \( L \), \( D \), \( L^\top \), we split \( D \) equally between \( L \) and \( L^\top \).
- The matrix \( D \) is decomposed into its square root, essentially assigning "half" of its contribution to \( L \) and "half" to \( L^\top \).

For example:

$$
D = \text{diag}(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)
$$

Take the square root:

$$
\sqrt{D} = \text{diag}(\sqrt{d_1}, \sqrt{d_2}, \dots, \sqrt{d_n})
$$

The decomposition then becomes:

$$
A = \sqrt{D} L \sqrt{D} L^\top
$$

---

### Elementary Matrix Logic Behind the Process

1. **Row Multiplication**:
The square root component \( \sqrt{D} \) from the **left** multiplies rows of the original matrix.

2. **Column Multiplication**:
The square root component \( \sqrt{D} \) from the **right** multiplies columns of the original matrix.

Thus, we take the square root of diagonal entries:

$$
L = \sqrt{D} \cdot L
$$

and update the corresponding columns/rows based on the pivot values.

---

### Relation to Cholesky Factorization

- The **Késki Decomposition** can be seen as a simplification of the **Cholesky Factorization**.
- While Cholesky directly decomposes \( A \) as:

$$
A = LL^\top
$$

Késki modifies this decomposition to emphasize the splitting of \( D \) between \( L \) and \( L^\top \).

---

### Applications of Késki Decomposition

- **Probability & Statistics**:
  - Used for generating random variables with specified standard deviations and correlations.
  - Central in Monte Carlo simulations for modeling distributions.
  
- **Finance**:
  - Applications in risk modeling, derivative pricing, and portfolio optimization.

- **Geodesy and Land Surveying**:
  - Named after Cholesky due to his profession as a surveyor, though specific surveying applications are less documented.

---

### Summary

#### Conditions for Késki Decomposition:
1. Matrix \( A \) must be **symmetric**.
2. Matrix \( A \)'s **pivots must be positive**.

#### Decomposition Form:

$$
A = L D^{1/2} L^\top D^{1/2}
$$

This simplification reduces the complexity while retaining the structure required for physical applications.
