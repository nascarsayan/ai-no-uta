## Matrix Decomposition: Steps and Explanation

### 1. Evaluate $A^T A$
To begin the decomposition of matrix $A$, the first step is to calculate $A^T A$. 

### 2. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of $A^T A$
- Next, we evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A^T A$.
- The eigenvalue decomposition of $A^T A$ provides the following:
  - Columns of matrix $X$ are the eigenvectors of $A^T A$.
  - Eigenvalues are placed along the diagonal of a matrix $D$.

### 3. Properties of Eigenvectors
- The eigenvectors of $A^T A$ are orthogonal.
- These can be normalized to be orthonormal if needed (e.g., dividing each vector by its magnitude).

### 4. Eigenvalue Decomposition for $A^T A$
- Carefully choosing matrix $A$ such that the eigenvalues of $A^T A$ are perfect squares simplifies subsequent calculations.
- Let the eigenvalues of $A^T A$ be:
  
  $$
  \text{Eigenvalues: } 25, \, 225, \, \text{and } 2025
  $$

### 5. Diagonal Matrix $S$
- The diagonal matrix $S$ is derived from the square roots of the eigenvalues. For the given eigenvalues:
  
  $$
  \sqrt{25} = 5, \, \sqrt{225} = 15, \, \sqrt{2025} = 45
  $$
  
- Matrix $S$ is:

  $$
  S = \text{diag}(5, 15, 45)
  $$

### 6. Calculate $S^{-1}$
The inverse of $S$, denoted $S^{-1}$, is required for the next step.

### 7. Compute $Q$
- The matrix $Q$ is calculated as follows:

  $$
  Q = A S^{-1}
  $$

- This operation ensures that $Q$ is orthogonal.

### 8. Verify the Decomposition
To confirm the decomposition is correct:

- Verify that:

  $$
  A = Q S
  $$

- Multiply $Q$ and $S$ to reconstruct matrix $A$.
- If the result equals the original matrix $A$, the decomposition is validated.

### 9. Summary
The decomposition can be summarized as follows:
- $A$ is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and a symmetric matrix $S$.
- Mathematically:

  $$
  A = Q S
  $$
