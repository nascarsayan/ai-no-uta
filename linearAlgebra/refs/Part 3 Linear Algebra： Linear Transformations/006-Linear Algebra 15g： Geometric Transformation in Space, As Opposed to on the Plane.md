## 1. Geometric Transformations in Space

### Transformations Discussed:
- Reflection
- Projection
- Rotation
- Translation

### Overview:
- Transitioning the study of geometric transformations from the plane to three-dimensional space.
- Focus on **linear transformations** like reflection, projection, and rotation, along with their eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

## 2. Reflection in 3D Space

### Types of Reflection:
1. With respect to a **plane**.
2. With respect to a **straight line**.

#### 2.1 Reflection with Respect to a Plane:
- Requires a plane passing through the **origin**.
- Transformation: For any vector $\vec{v}$, draw a line perpendicular to the plane, continuing the same distance beyond the plane. The reflected vector is the result.

**Key Properties**:
1. **Linear** Transformation (as shown by reasoning in 2D).
2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Any vector **in the reflection plane** is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.
    - Any vector **perpendicular to the reflection plane** is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda = -1$.
    - Eigenvalues in this case: $\{1, 1, -1\}$.

**Equation**:
Reflection satisfies: Reflecting twice results in the original vector, analogous to $x^2 = 1$, which has roots \(+1\) and \(-1\).

#### 2.2 Reflection with Respect to a Line:
- Any vector is reflected across a **line passing through the origin**.
- Transformation: Draw a line perpendicular to the line of reflection and continue the reflection across to the other side.

**Key Properties**:
1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Vectors **along the line of reflection** are eigenvectors with eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.
    - Any vector **orthogonal to the line** (within an orthogonal plane) reflects to form eigenvectors with eigenvalue $\lambda = -1$.
    - Eigenvalues: $\{1, -1, -1\}$.

## 3. Projection in 3D Space

### Types of Projection:
1. **Onto a plane**.
2. **Onto a straight line**.

#### 3.1 Projection Onto a Plane:
- Transformation: Draw a line perpendicular to the plane from the tip of the vector, stopping where it intersects the plane.

**Key Properties**:
1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Vectors **in the plane** are eigenvectors with eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.
    - Vectors **orthogonal to the plane** map to the zero vector with eigenvalue $\lambda = 0$.
    - Eigenvalues: $\{1, 1, 0\}$.

2. **Twice projected vectors** remain the same:
   $$
   \text{Projection satisfies: } P^2 = P.
   $$

#### 3.2 Projection Onto a Line:
- Transformation: Draw a perpendicular line to the axis of projection to find the image.

**Key Properties**:
1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Vectors **along the line** are eigenvectors with eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.
    - Vectors **orthogonal to the line** project to zero with eigenvalue $\lambda = 0$.
    - Eigenvalues: $\{1, 0, 0\}$.

2. Property:
   $$
   P^2 = P
   $$

## 4. Rotation in 3D Space

### Defining Rotation:
- A rotation is defined relative to an **axis of rotation**.
- Use the **right-hand rule** to determine the positive direction.

**Transformation in Action**:
- Vectors are rotated around the specified axis by an angle.

**Key Properties**:
1. There is always **one direction that remains unchanged**: The **axis of rotation**.
2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Only eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$, associated with the eigenvector along the **axis of rotation**.
    - No other eigenvectors in the real number space since all other vectors are rotated.
    - **Eigenvalue count**: $\{1\}$.

**Note**: Rotations with **complex numbers** will exhibit additional eigenvalues.

## 5. Translation in 3D Space

### Defining Translation:
- Add a **constant vector** to every vector in the space.

**Key Properties**:
1. **Non-linear** transformation.
2. No eigenvalues or eigenvectors are applicable.

---

## 6. Summary of Transformations

### Key Observations:
1. Reflections and Projections:
    - The **number of eigenvalues equals the dimension** of the space.
    - Real eigenvalues are sufficient for analyzing these transformations.
2. Rotations:
    - Only one eigenvalue in standard real spaces (the axis of rotation).
    - Extending to **complex numbers** introduces additional eigenvalues.
3. Translations:
    - Non-linear thus not applicable for eigenvalue analysis.

### Mathematical Analogies:
- Reflections: $x^2 = 1$, eigenvalues are roots $\{+1, -1\}$.
- Projections: $P^2 = P$, eigenvalues $\{0, 1\}$.

**Concluding Thought**:
- Transformations that exist in 2D have meaningful analogues in 3D space but exhibit richer geometric and algebraic behaviors.
