## Polynomial Transformation and Matrix Representation

### 1. Defining the Linear Transformation
- A linear transformation $S$ is introduced, which transforms any polynomial as follows:
  $$
  S(p(x)) = 2p(x) + (x-1)p'(x)
  $$
- The transformation is described as "silly" due to its lack of practical applications but serves as a good theoretical example.

### 2. Applying the Transformation to a Polynomial
- Example: Let $p(x) = x^2 + 2x$. Applying $S$:
  $$
  S(x^2 + 2x) = 2(x^2 + 2x) + (x - 1)(2x + 2)
  $$
  Simplifying step-by-step:
  $$
  2(x^2 + 2x) = 2x^2 + 4x 
  $$
  $$
  (x-1)(2x+2) = 2x^2 - 2x 
  $$
  Combine terms:
  $$
  S(x^2 + 2x) = 4x^2 + 4x - 2
  $$

### 3. Analyzing Transformation in Component Space
#### Choosing a Basis
- Basis vectors: $\{x - 1, x + 1, x^2\}$.
- Objective: Represent $S$ as a $3 \times 3$ matrix in this basis.

#### Representing the Basis Transformation
1. **First Basis Element ($p_1(x) = x-1$):**
   $$
   S(x-1) = 2(x-1) + (x-1)\cdot 1 = 3(x-1)
   $$
   Coefficients in the basis: $[3, 0, 0]$.

2. **Second Basis Element ($p_2(x) = x+1$):**
   $$
   S(x+1) = 2(x+1) + (x-1)\cdot 1 = 3(x+1).
   $$
   Coefficients in the basis: $[0, 3, 0]$.

3. **Third Basis Element ($p_3(x) = x^2$):**
   $$
   S(x^2) = 2x^2 + (x-1) \cdot 2x = 4x^2 - 2x.
   $$
   Coefficients in the basis: $[0, -2, 4]$.

#### Constructing the Matrix
The matrix representation of $S$ in the basis $\{x-1, x+1, x^2\}$:
$$
S =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 3 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### 4. Validating the Matrix Representation
- Decomposing $p(x) = x^2 + 2x$ in the chosen basis:
  $$
  p(x) = 1(x-1) + 1(x+1) + x^2 \implies \text{coefficients} = [1, 1, 1].
  $$

- Calculating $S(p(x))$ via matrix multiplication:
  $$
  S(p(x)) = S \cdot 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\ 1 \\ 1
  \end{bmatrix} 
  = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    3 \\ 1 \\ 4
  \end{bmatrix}.
  $$

- Reconstructing the polynomial:
  $$
  3(x-1) + 1(x+1) + 4x^2 = 4x^2 + 4x - 2.
  $$

- This matches the earlier result for $S(x^2 + 2x)$, confirming correctness.

### 5. Direct vs. Component Space Approach
- Direct: Compute $S(p(x))$ directly.
- Component Space:
  1. Decompose $p(x)$ in basis.
  2. Apply the transformation as matrix multiplication.
  3. Reconstruct polynomial from transformed coefficients.
- Both approaches yield the same result, validating the representation.

### 6. Key Takeaways
- The matrix encodes the transformation by capturing the action of $S$ on basis elements.
- This algorithmical relationship between polynomials and their matrix representations in linear transformations is consistent and reliable.
