## Eigenvalues of $A$ and $A^T$

### Key fact:
- **Eigenvalues of $A$ and $A^T$ are identical**, though their eigenvectors may differ. 
- This result is based on the equality of their determinants: $\text{det}(A) = \text{det}(A^T)$.

---

### Demonstration:
1. To calculate eigenvalues, we use the **characteristic polynomial** of a matrix. 
   - For a matrix $A$, the characteristic polynomial, denoted by $P_A$, is computed by subtracting $\lambda$ (eigenvalue) from the diagonal entries of $A$ and then taking the determinant:
   
     $$
     P_A(\lambda) = \text{det}(A - \lambda I)
     $$
     
   - Here, $I$ is the identity matrix.

2. Similarly, the characteristic polynomial for $A^T$ is computed as:
   
     $$
     P_{A^T}(\lambda) = \text{det}(A^T - \lambda I)
     $$

3. Notice that subtracting $\lambda I$ from the diagonal of $A^T$ simply transposes the resulting matrix $(A - \lambda I)$:
   
     $$
     A^T - \lambda I = (A - \lambda I)^T
     $$

4. Since the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose, i.e., 
   
     $$
     \text{det}(M) = \text{det}(M^T)
     $$
     
   for any matrix $M$, we conclude that:
     
     $$
     P_A(\lambda) = P_{A^T}(\lambda)
     $$

### Consequence:
- Identical characteristic polynomials mean identical eigenvalues for $A$ and $A^T$ since eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation.

---

### Visual Explanation:
- Imagine subtracting $\lambda$ from the diagonal of $A$ and $A^T$:
  - The resulting matrices are transposes of each other.
  - Hence, their determinants—and consequently their eigenvalues—are the same.

---

### Algebraic Explanation:
- The identity matrix $I$ is symmetric (${I}^T = I$). Hence, replacing $I$ with $I^T$ in the subtraction does not change the structure:
  
     $$
     A - \lambda I \text{ and } A^T - \lambda I^T
     $$
     
   are transposes of each other.

- Therefore, algebraically:
  
     $$
     \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = \text{det}((A - \lambda I)^T)
     $$ 

   which corroborates the visual result.

### Conclusion:
- Since the characteristic polynomials of $A$ and $A^T$ are identical, their eigenvalues are the same.
- This simple, yet crucial property is foundational in linear algebra.
