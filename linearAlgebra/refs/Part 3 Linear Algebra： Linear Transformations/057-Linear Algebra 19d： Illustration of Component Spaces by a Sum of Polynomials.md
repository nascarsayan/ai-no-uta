## Example of Polynomial Decomposition and Linear Combination

### Problem Objective

- Compute a slightly more complicated linear combination of two polynomials.
- Simulate real-life scenarios:
  1. Translate elements to component spaces using a basis.
  2. Solve the problem in component space.
  3. Convert the answer back to "real-life" polynomials.

### Basis Selected

The basis consists of:
1. $x^2 + x + 1$
2. $x + 1$
3. $1$ (constant polynomial)

### Decomposition of $P$

Given $P = 3x^2$:
- To create $3x^2$, take 3 multiples of $x^2 + x + 1$.
- Cancel the $x$ term using $-3(x + 1)$.
- Adjust the constant term with $-5(1)$.

Thus:
$$
P = 3(x^2 + x + 1) - 3(x + 1) - 5(1)
$$

Or equivalently in component space:
$$
P = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Decomposition of $Q$

Given $Q = x - 2$:
- To match $x$, take 1 multiple of $x^2 + x + 1$.
- Adjust $x$ term with $-2(x + 1)$.
- Adjust the constant term for $-1$ using $8$.

Thus:
$$
Q = 1(x^2 + x + 1) - 2(x + 1) + 8(1)
$$

Or equivalently in component space:
$$
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### Linear Combination in Component Space

Compute $3P + 2Q$:
$$
3P + 2Q = 3\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix} + 2\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Perform the matrix addition:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
3(3) + 2(1) \\ 
3(-3) + 2(-2) \\ 
3(-5) + 2(8)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 11 \\ -13 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Synthesis: Convert Back to Real-Life Vector (Polynomial)

Using the components:
$$
3P + 2Q = 11(x^2 + x + 1) - 13(x + 1) + 1(1)
$$

Combine terms:
#### Coefficients:
- $x^2: 11$
- $x: 11 - 13 = -2 + 1 = -1$
- Constant: Same as $1$

Final Polynomial:
$$
11x^2 - x + 1
$$

### Three-Step Summary

1. **Transform into Component Space:**
   Represent polynomials $P$ and $Q$ using selected basis. This results in numerical vectors.

2. **Solve Problem in Component Space:**
   Perform linear combination in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

3. **Synthesize Back to Real-World Polynomials:**
   Convert numerical results back to polynomial representation.

### Validation

Directly compute $P$ and $Q$ components without basis and verify:
- Combine $P = 3x^2 - x - 5$ and $Q = x - 2$ using $3P + 2Q$.
- Result matches: $11x^2 - x + 1$.

### Conclusion

This method effectively simplifies solving complex polynomial problems, especially when dealing with higher dimensions or component spaces. The approach:
1. Converts real-life challenges to abstract vector spaces.
2. Facilitates solving the problem efficiently.
3. Derives accurate real-life results after synthesis.
