## Eigenvalue Decomposition: Applications and Insights

### 1. **Introduction to Eigenvalue Decomposition**
- **Theme**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide deep insights into matrices.
  - They encapsulate all necessary information about the matrix without loss.
  - With eigenvalues and eigenvectors, one can:
    - Apply the matrix to any vector.
    - Reconstruct the matrix itself.

### 2. **Matrix Squaring Using Eigenvalue Decomposition**
If a matrix $A$ can be expressed via eigenvalue decomposition as $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$, then:

#### Squaring $A$:

$$
A^2 = A \cdot A = (X \Lambda X^{-1}) \cdot (X \Lambda X^{-1})
$$

- By associativity of matrix multiplication:
  
$$
A^2 = X \Lambda (X^{-1} X) \Lambda X^{-1}
$$

- Observing:
  - $X^{-1} X$ simplifies to the identity matrix.
  - Matrices simplify neatly when in this form:
  
$$
A^2 = X \Lambda^2 X^{-1}
$$

#### Insights:
- $A^2$ has the same eigenvectors as $A$.
- The eigenvalues of $A^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $A$.
- **Diagonal matrix operations**:
  - Raising a diagonal matrix to power $n$ is straightforward:
    - Just raise each diagonal entry to the power $n$.

- Generalization:
  - This approach works for any integer power $n$, including negative integers (e.g., matrix inverses).

### 3. **Matrix Inverse Using Eigenvalue Decomposition**
For the inverse of matrix $A$:

- Assume $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$.
- By definition, the inverse is:

$$
A^{-1} = X \Lambda^{-1} X^{-1}
$$

- **Inverting $\Lambda$**:
  - If $\Lambda$ is diagonal, inverting it is simply replacing each diagonal entry $\lambda$ with $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ (assuming all $\lambda \neq 0$).

### 4. **Raising Matrices to Arbitrary Powers**
#### General Framework:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can simplify raising $A$ to any power $n$ (integer or non-integer).

- The formula:

$$
A^n = X \Lambda^n X^{-1}
$$

- For diagonal $\Lambda$, compute powers by applying the function to each diagonal entry:
  - E.g., for non-integer powers:
    - $\lambda^{1/2}$ for a square root.
    - $\lambda^n$ for fractional powers.

#### Applications:
- Quick computation of $A^3$, $A^4$, etc., once eigenvalue decomposition is established.
- Efficiency highlighted when multiple powers (e.g., $A$, $A^2$, $A^3$, ...) are needed.

### 5. **Matrix Functions with Eigenvalue Decomposition**
#### Exploiting the Framework:
Eigenvalue decomposition enables computation of functions of matrices (not just integer powers).

- **Definition**:
  Any function $f(A)$ can be derived as:

$$
f(A) = X f(\Lambda) X^{-1}
$$

- **Applying a Function**:
  - Compute $f(\Lambda)$ by applying $f$ to each diagonal entry of $\Lambda$.
    - Example: For $e^A$, this translates to $e^\lambda$ for each eigenvalue $\lambda$.

#### Examples:
- Exponential of a matrix:
  
$$
e^A = X \, e^\Lambda \, X^{-1}
$$

- Logarithmic or other functions can also be defined in similar ways.

### 6. **Fibonacci Numbers via Eigenvalue Decomposition (Preview)**
- The power-raising property of eigenvalue decomposition will be used:
  - To establish a **closed-form expression** for the $n$th Fibonacci number.
- This demonstrates the practical application of these theoretical concepts to real problems.

### 7. **Closing Remarks**
- Eigenvalue decomposition provides tools for:
  - Simplified matrix manipulation (squaring, inverting, raising to powers, applying functions).
  - Deeper insights into the matrix and its structure.
- Further exploration:
  - Application to defining and computing functions of matrices.
  - Practical computation of solutions to iterative processes and sequences.
