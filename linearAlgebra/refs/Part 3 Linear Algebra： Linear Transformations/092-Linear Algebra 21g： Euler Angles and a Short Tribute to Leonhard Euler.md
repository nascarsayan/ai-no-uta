## Euler Angles: Overview

### Definition
- Euler angles are a method for specifying arbitrary rotations in 3D space using **three parameters**.  
- These angles help describe the orientation of a rigid body relative to a reference configuration.  

---

### Historical Context
- Named after **Leonhard Euler**, a monumental figure in the history of mathematics and physics.
- Euler's contributions to science are unmatched, shaping modern mathematics and many areas of physics.

## 1. **Why Three Parameters?**
- To fully specify a rigid body's orientation:
  1. **Two parameters** determine the **direction** in which the body points (like latitude and longitude on a sphere).
  2. **One parameter** defines the **amount of twist** around that direction.
  
### Parameter Description:
1. **$\theta$ (Theta):** Corresponds to latitude.
   - $\theta = 0$: North Pole.
   - $\theta = \pi / 2$: Equator.
   - $\theta = \pi$: South Pole.
   - Measures deviation from the vertical $z$-axis.
2. **$\phi$ (Phi):** Corresponds to longitude.
   - Specifies the rotation around the vertical axis in the **East-West** (counter-clockwise) direction.
3. **$\psi$ (Psi):** Represents the **twist** about the body-fixed axis.

---

## 2. **Geometric Interpretation**
### Latitude ($\theta$):
- Determines how the body tilts away from the $z$-axis.
- Analogous to **latitudes** on a globe, but with adjusted scaling:
  $$
  \theta = 0 \text{ at the North Pole, } \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ at the Equator, and } \pi \text{ at the South Pole.}
  $$

### Longitude ($\phi$):
- Defines rotation around the $z$-axis (counter-clockwise when viewed from above).

### Twist ($\psi$):
- Measures the rotational angle around the body's own axis after setting the direction.

## 3. **Order of Operations in Euler Angles**

- Properly defining **Euler angles** requires not just the three parameters ($\theta, \phi, \psi$), but also the **rotation convention** that specifies **how the operations are performed**.

### Common Procedure:
1. **Step 1:** Set the **twist** ($\psi$) while the body aligns with the reference axis.
   - Use the rotation matrix for $z$-axis:
     $$
     R_z(\psi) = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\psi & -\sin\psi & 0 \\
     \sin\psi & \cos\psi & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$
     
2. **Step 2:** Define the **tilt** or **lean** ($\theta$) from the vertical axis.
   - This is a rotation about the $y$-axis:
     $$ 
     R_y(\theta) = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta & 0 & \sin\theta \\
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     -\sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$

3. **Step 3:** Apply **rotation in longitude** ($\phi$) to specify East-West positioning.
   - Accomplished by using $R_z(\phi)$ as in Step 1.

## 4. **Subtleties in Conventions**

### Subtlety 1: Path Dependency
- **How you arrive at a given orientation matters**:
  - Different sequences of rotations may lead to the same direction ($\theta, \phi$) but differ in the twist around that direction.
- Example:
  - A single direct lean away by $\theta$ results in no extra twist.
  - A lean in a different direction followed by adjustments can lead to incorrect configurations unless precisely tracked.

### Subtlety 2: Order Matters
- The order of applying $\psi, \theta, \phi$ impacts which rotation matrix can be used:
  - **Problem with Yaw-Pitch-Roll Order:**
    - The final axis of rotation might not align with the fixed $z$, $y$, or $x$ axes.
  - **Solution: Apply Twist Early.**

---

## 5. **Correct Convention for Euler Angles**

1. **Twist First ($\psi$):** 
   - Use $R_z(\psi)$ when the body is still aligned with the reference.
2. **Tilt Next ($\theta$):**
   - Lean using $R_y(\theta)$ to set the vertical deviation.
3. **Longitude Last ($\phi$):**
   - Final East-West rotation using $R_z(\phi)$.  

This ZYX rotation sequence (Extrinsic) avoids complications and ensures simplicity in formulating the combined rotation matrix.

---

## 6. **Key Takeaways**
- **Euler angles are not just numbers**, but a *specific convention for applying rotational transformations* in 3D space.
- They map one unique orientation to a specific set of parameters ($\psi, \theta, \phi$).

---

## 7. **Next Steps**
- Combine the rotation matrices ($R_z(\psi), R_y(\theta), R_z(\phi)$) to form one single matrix:
  - Represents an arbitrary 3D orientation as a single $3 \times 3$ **rotation matrix**.
- Explore **properties** of this matrix, especially in relation to rigid body dynamics.
