## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a 5x5 Matrix

### Matrix Overview
We analyze a 5x5 matrix and aim to determine all its eigenvalues and all but one of its eigenvectors.

### Identifying the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

#### First Eigenvalue: $\lambda = 6$
- **Observation:** 6 is alone in its column and appears on the diagonal.
- **Eigenvector**:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
    $$

---

#### Second Eigenvalue: $\lambda = 9$
- **Observation:** 9 is alone in its column and appears on the diagonal.
- **Eigenvector**:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    $$

---

#### Third Eigenvalue: $\lambda = 11$
- **Observation:** Each row sums up to 11.
- **Eigenvector**:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    $$

---

#### Fourth Eigenvalue: $\lambda = 0$
- **Observation:** The second column is 3 times the first column, showing linear dependence between the columns.
- **Eigenvector**:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
    $$

---

#### Fifth Eigenvalue: $\lambda = -3$
- **Observation:** Using the trace of the matrix, we can calculate the missing eigenvalue.  
    - **Trace:** The sum of the diagonal entries is 13.  
    - **Sum of Existing Eigenvalues:** $6 + 9 + 11 + 0 = 26$.  
    - **Remaining Eigenvalue:** Since the trace equals the sum of all eigenvalues:
      $$
      \lambda = 13 - 26 = -3
      $$
- **Eigenvector:** Computation is non-trivial and was not determined.

### Key Takeaways
- By systematically analyzing the matrix using special properties (diagonal elements, row sums, null space relationships, and trace), we were able to:
    - Determine **all eigenvalues** ($6$, $9$, $11$, $0$, $-3$).
    - Identify **four corresponding eigenvectors**.  
- The matrix has special symmetry that made this analysis efficient despite being dense.
