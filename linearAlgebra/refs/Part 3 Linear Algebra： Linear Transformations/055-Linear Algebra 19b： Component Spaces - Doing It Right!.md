### 1. Components, Basis, and Representation of Vectors

Vectors can be represented by sets of numbers via the concept of a basis:
- **Method**: Choose a basis and decompose all vectors in the vector space with respect to that basis.
- **Result**: Organize the resulting components into columns as elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  
Example in $\mathbb{R}^2$:
  
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### 2. Equivalence of Vector Spaces  
- Using components spaces, all vector spaces can be equated to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- Advantages of component spaces:
    - They simplify calculations.
    - They fit naturally within standard linear algebra methods.
  
However, there are reserves:
- Component spaces might be **overused** when not necessary.
- Improper use can obscure intuition and understanding.

### 3. Avoiding Premature Components Spaces  
#### Why avoid premature use?
1. **Unnecessary Complexity**:
    - Introducing bases or coordinate systems disrupts clarity and simplicity inherent to linear algebra.
2. **Loss of Intuition**:
    - By prematurely converting meaningful objects into dry sets number intuitive geometric starts from living behind./Use aptly.
