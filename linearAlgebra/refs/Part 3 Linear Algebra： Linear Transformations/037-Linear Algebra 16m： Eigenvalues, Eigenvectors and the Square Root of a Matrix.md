## 1. Matrix $A^2$: A Natural Matrix

### Matrix $A^2$:
- $A^2$ represents the square of a matrix, defined as $A \times A$.
- This is a natural matrix to consider when discussing linear transformations.

### Linear Transformations:
- Matrices represent linear transformations.
- Example: A **rotation transformation**:
  - Rotate a body.
  - Take a picture.
  - Rotate it again.
  - Take another picture.
  
### Combined Linear Transformations:
- When applying the same transformation twice, the result is a new linear transformation.
- This new combined linear transformation is represented by $A^2$:
  $$
  A^2 = A \times A
  $$

- **Key Takeaway**: $A^2$ is essential when modeling situations where multiple rounds of the same transformation are applied in sequence.
