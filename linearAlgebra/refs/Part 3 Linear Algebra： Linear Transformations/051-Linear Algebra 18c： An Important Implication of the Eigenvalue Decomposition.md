## Eigenvalue Decomposition: Insights and Key Questions

### Questions Addressed:
1. **Can we construct a matrix given a prescribed set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors?**
    - Answer: **Yes.** The eigenvalue decomposition allows us to construct such a matrix using:
      - The eigenvalues placed on the diagonal of a matrix $\Lambda$.
      - The eigenvectors placed as columns in a matrix $X$.
      - The constructed matrix formula: $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$.

2. **Is the matrix with the prescribed eigenvalues and eigenvectors unique?**
    - Answer: **Yes.** There is only one matrix with a prescribed set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This will be explored further below.

### Structure of Eigenvalue Decomposition

#### Constructing the Matrix:
- Place eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$ along the diagonal of a diagonal matrix:

    $$
    \Lambda = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \lambda_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
    0 & \lambda_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & \lambda_n
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- Place corresponding eigenvectors $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_n$ as **column vectors** in a matrix $X$.

- Ensure the correspondence between eigenvectors (in $X$) and eigenvalues (in $\Lambda$). For example:
    - Eigenvector $\vec{v}_1$ corresponds to eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ and thus goes into the first column of $X$.

- The matrix formula is:

    $$
    A = X \Lambda X^{-1}.
    $$

#### Example:
If given eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = 7$, $\lambda_2 = 4$, $\lambda_3 = 3$, and corresponding eigenvectors:

    $$
    \vec{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 
    \vec{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 
    \vec{v}_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},
    $$

then:

    $$
    \Lambda = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    7 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 4 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 3
    \end{bmatrix}, \quad
    X = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix},
    $$

and the matrix $A$ is reconstructed as $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$.

### Uniqueness of the Matrix

To demonstrate the **uniqueness** of the matrix $A$:
1. Start from the decomposition $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$.
2. Assume there exists another matrix $B$ with the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
3. Following similar steps for $B$, you find:

    $$
    A = B = X \Lambda X^{-1}.
    $$

Thus, $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the same matrix. **There is no other matrix with the same eigenvalues and eigenvectorsâ€”such a matrix is unique.**

### Equivalence in Eigenvalue Decomposition

#### Notion of Equivalence:
While the matrix $A$ is unique, there can be alternative **equivalent decompositions** of $A$ due to:
1. **Reordering eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues in $\Lambda$ can be reordered as long as the eigenvectors in $X$ and $X^{-1}$ are arranged consistently. For example:
   - Switching the places of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ in $\Lambda$ requires swapping the first and second columns in $X$.
 
2. **Changing eigenvector scalings**:
   - Each eigenvector can be scaled by a nonzero scalar without affecting the eigenvalue decomposition. For example:
     
     If $\vec{v}$ is an eigenvector, $k\vec{v}$ (where $k \neq 0$) is still a valid eigenvector.

### Non-Uniqueness in the Decomposition:

While eigenvalue decomposition is often referred to as "unique" in spirit, it has some built-in arbitrariness:
1. **Order of eigenvalues**:
   - Different orderings of $\Lambda$ result in different (but equivalent) decompositions.

2. **Scaling of eigenvectors**:
   - Scaling eigenvectors (e.g., $\vec{v}_i$ replaced with $c\vec{v}_i$ for any nonzero $c$) alters $X$ but not the resulting matrix $A$.

3. **Degenerate eigenvalues**:
   - If two or more eigenvalues are the same, then any linearly independent combination of their corresponding eigenvectors will form an equivalent decomposition.

### Key Takeaways:
- The **matrix $A$ is uniquely determined** by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- The eigenvalue decomposition itself is **not strictly unique** due to reordering of eigenvalues, scaling of eigenvectors, and other factors.
- The family of different decompositions are **equivalent** and yield the same original matrix $A$.

Eigenvalue decomposition thus captures the **essence of a matrix**, reducing it to its basic components while retaining all critical information.
