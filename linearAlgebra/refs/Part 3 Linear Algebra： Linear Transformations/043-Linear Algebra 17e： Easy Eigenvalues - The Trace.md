## Eigenvalues and Trace

### The Trace and Eigenvalues
- The **trace** of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues.
- Useful property: If all eigenvalues except one are known, the remaining eigenvalue can be determined using the trace.

### Example

**Matrix given:**
We consider a matrix where two eigenvalues are already known.

#### Known Eigenvalues:
1. **Eigenvalue**: $7$  
    - Found due to its position alone in its column on the diagonal.
    - **Corresponding Eigenvector**: $[0, 0, 1]$

2. **Eigenvalue**: $10$  
    - Found because every row adds up to the same number, $10$.  
    - **Corresponding Eigenvector**: $[1, 1, 1]$

#### Finding the Third Eigenvalue:
From the trace property:
- Total trace of the matrix = $14$
- Sum of the known eigenvalues = $7 + 10 = 17$
  
The third eigenvalue is:
$$
\lambda_3 = \text{Trace} - (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2) = 14 - 17 = -3
$$

So, the third eigenvalue is $-3$, but the corresponding eigenvector is not known yet.

### Corresponding Eigenvector for $-3$
To find the eigenvector for $\lambda_3 = -3$:
1. Subtract $-3$ from the diagonal elements of the matrix. Subtracting $-3$ is equivalent to adding $3$ on the diagonal.  
   - The resulting matrix becomes singular.

2. Perform operations on the updated matrix to isolate the proportion between columns:
   - For instance, take the first two columns in proportion (e.g., $1:-1$ or $8:-5$) to cancel out certain entries.
   - Resulting eigenvector: It may have large coefficients (e.g., $[40, -25, 1]$).

Thus, after some calculations, the eigenvector for $-3$ is determined.

### Summary of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
1. **Eigenvalue**: $7$  
   - **Eigenvector**: $[0, 0, 1]$
   
2. **Eigenvalue**: $10$  
   - **Eigenvector**: $[1, 1, 1]$
   
3. **Eigenvalue**: $-3$  
   - **Eigenvector**: $[40, -25, 1]$

These eigenvalues and eigenvectors were determined without solving the characteristic equation and using properties such as:
- The **trace** property.
- Row sums adding up to the same value (second eigenvalue).
- Subtracting eigenvalues from the diagonal results in a singular matrix to find corresponding eigenvectors.

### Key Observations:
- The trace property is both simple yet "magical." It allows identification of eigenvalues with very little work in some cases.
- Eigenvectors may involve significant computations, especially for non-obvious eigenvalues.
- This highlights the interplay between algebraic methods (diagnosing the diagonal and trace properties) and numerical solving for eigenvectors.
