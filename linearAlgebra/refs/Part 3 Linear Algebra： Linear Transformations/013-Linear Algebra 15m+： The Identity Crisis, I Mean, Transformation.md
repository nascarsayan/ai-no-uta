## Identity Transformation and Its Properties

### Definition of Identity Transformation
- The **identity transformation** is one of the simplest linear transformations.
- It leaves every vector unchanged: whatever the input vector, it is also the output vector. Mathematically, we define it as:

  $$
  I(V) = V
  $$

  where $V$ is the input vector, and $I$ is the identity transformation.

- This transformation can be defined on any vector space:
  - For geometric vectors, whatever vector is input is returned as output.
  - For polynomial spaces, the same polynomial comes out as output.
  - For $\mathbb{R}^n$, any input vector (a set of numbers) is returned unchanged.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Identity Transformation
- The identity transformation leaves every vector unchanged, which aligns with the eigenvalue relationship:

  $$
  I(V) = \lambda V
  $$

  Here, $\lambda = 1$. Thus:
  - Every vector is an eigenvector with the eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.

- **Eigenvalues**: The only eigenvalue of the identity transformation is $\lambda = 1$.
- **Multiplicity**: The eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$ has a multiplicity equal to the dimension of the space.
- **Eigenvectors**: Every vector in the space is an eigenvector for $\lambda = 1$.

### Summary
- The identity transformation:
  - Has one eigenvalue: $\lambda = 1$.
  - Has multiplicity of $\lambda = 1$ equal to the dimension of the space.
  - Makes every vector in the space an eigenvector.
