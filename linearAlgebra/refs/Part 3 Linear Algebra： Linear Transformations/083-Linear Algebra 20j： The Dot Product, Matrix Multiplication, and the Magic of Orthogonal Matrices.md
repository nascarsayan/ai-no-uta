## Matrix Multiplication and Dot Product Perspective

### Matrix Multiplication Dimensions & Entries
- **Matrix Compatibility**:
    - First matrix: $4 \times 3$ (4 rows, 3 columns).
    - Second matrix: $3 \times 5$ (3 rows, 5 columns).
    - Resulting matrix: $4 \times 5$.

- **Entry-wise Calculation**:
    - Each entry in the resulting matrix is the **dot product** of:
        1. A **row** from the first matrix.
        2. A **column** from the second matrix.
    - Example: The $(i, j)$ entry is computed as $ \text{row}_i \cdot \text{col}_j$.

### Geometry Perspective
- Instead of treating these purely as $n$-dimensional vectors, one can view rows and columns as **geometric vectors** in a space.
- **Interpretation**:
    - The dot product of two vectors equals the product of their magnitudes and $\cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between them.

## $A^T A$ Matrix: Interpretations and Properties

### Definition:
- Compute $A^T A$, where $A^T$ (transpose of matrix $A$) is multiplied with $A$.
- If $A$ has 4 columns ($n=4$), then $A^T A$ forms a **symmetric square matrix** of size $4 \times 4$.

### Dot Product Interpretation:
- Entries of $A^T A$:
    - **Diagonal entries**: Dot products of vectors with themselves (length squared).
    - **Off-diagonal entries**: Dot products of distinct columns (interactions between columns).
- **Orthogonality**:
    - If all columns are mutually orthogonal, **off-diagonal entries** will be $0$.
    - Resulting matrix is **diagonal**.

## Orthogonal Columns and $A^T A$

### Orthogonality Consequence:
1. If all **columns** are orthogonal, $A^T A$ becomes a **diagonal matrix**.
2. Additionally, if all columns are of **unit length**:
    - $A^T A$ transforms into the **identity matrix**.

## Orthonormality and Orthogonal Matrices

### Definition:
- **Orthonormal Vectors**:
    - Vectors that are both **orthogonal** and have **unit length**.
    - Basis vectors normalized to unit length.

### Orthogonal Matrix:
- **Condition**:
    - A matrix $Q$ satisfies: $Q^T Q = I$, (identity matrix).
    - Columns of $Q$ are **orthonormal vectors**.
  
### Properties:
1. Mutually **orthogonal columns** in $Q$.
2. If columns are orthonormal, **rows are orthonormal too** (derived from $Q^T Q = Q Q^T = I$).

### Naming Issue:
- Orthogonal matrices contain **orthonormal columns**, so technically should be called "orthonormal matrices."

## Key Results on Orthonormality

### Magic of Orthogonal Matrices:
1. **Columns and Rows Preservation**:
    - If the columns of matrix $Q$ are **orthonormal**, the **rows** are orthonormal too.

2. **Diagonal and Identity Matrix**:
    - Orthogonal columns yield a **diagonal matrix** when multiplied with their transpose.
    - Orthonormal columns specifically yield the **identity matrix**.

## Practical Examples

### Constructing an Orthogonal Matrix:
1. Start with **orthonormal vectors**.
2. Decompose each vector into components with respect to a chosen basis.
3. Assemble these as **columns** of your matrix.

### Verifications:
1. **Orthogonality of Columns**:
    - Compute the dot product between columns.
    - If result is $0$, they are orthogonal.
2. **Orthonormality Check**:
    - Compute the sum of squares of entries for each column.
    - Ensure this equals $1$ (unit length).
