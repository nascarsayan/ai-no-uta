## General Dot Product Formula in Arbitrary Basis

### Introduction
- The formula for the dot product is extended beyond Cartesian bases to an **arbitrary basis**.
- Arbitrary basis example:
  - Basis consists of:
    - One unit vector.
    - One vector of length 2.
    - The angle between these vectors equals $60^\circ$.
  - $\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$.

### Dot Product for Arbitrary Basis
- Consider two vectors **V** and **W**, represented in terms of the new basis, with coefficients:
  - $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ for **V**.
  - $\beta_1, \beta_2$ for **W**.
- The general distributive property of the dot product remains applicable:
  $$
  V \cdot W = (\alpha_1 \beta_1) + (\alpha_1 \beta_2) + (\alpha_2 \beta_1) + k (\alpha_2 \beta_2)
  $$
  Here, $k$ accounts for specific scaling/dot product values arising from the basis vectors.

### Computing Basis Dot Products
- Define basis vectors $B_1$ and $B_2$, associated with new basis properties:
  - $B_1 \cdot B_1 = \|B_1\|^2 = 1$.
  - $B_2 \cdot B_2 = \|B_2\|^2 = 4$ (since its length is 2).
  - $B_1 \cdot B_2 = \|B_1\| \|B_2\| \cos(60^\circ) = 1$.

### Matrix Representation of Dot Product
- Express dot product in matrix form:
  $$
  V \cdot W = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha_1 & \alpha_2 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  B_1 \cdot B_1 & B_1 \cdot B_2 \\
  B_2 \cdot B_1 & B_2 \cdot B_2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_1 \\
  \beta_2
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  For the specific basis mentioned:
  $$
  \text{Matrix (M)} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & 4
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- General matrix:
  $$
  \text{Matrix (M)} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  B_1 \cdot B_1 & B_1 \cdot B_2 \\
  B_2 \cdot B_1 & B_2 \cdot B_2
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

### General Matrix Formula
- The dot product in matrix notation is:
  $$
  V \cdot W = \alpha^\top M \beta
  $$
  **Properties:**
  - Symmetric matrix ($M_{ij} = M_{ji}$ due to commutativity of dot product).
  - Each entry is calculated as $B_i \cdot B_j$, where $M_{ij}$ corresponds to pairwise dot products in the basis.

### Alternative Names for the Matrix:
- **Gram Matrix**: Represents pairwise dot products within the given basis.
- **Inner Product Matrix**: Specific to the basis used for representation.
- **Metric Matrix**: Connects the dot product to measurements of length and angles.

## Summary
- The **dot product formula** has been generalized to arbitrary bases.
- The resulting expression includes adjustments tied to the properties of those bases, encapsulated by a **Matrix** of basis vector dot products.
- This approach preserves the distributive property while enabling computations in component spaces aligned to non-Cartesian bases.
